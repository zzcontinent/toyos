<h5>Patents</h5>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-top: 0.07cm; margin-bottom: 0.07cm"><font size="2">Attention is called to the possibility that
implementation of this standard may require use of subject matter covered by patent rights. By publication of this standard, no
position is taken with respect to the existence or validity of any patent rights in connection therewith. If a patent holder or patent
applicant has filed a statement of assurance via an Accepted Letter of Assurance, then the statement is listed on the IEEE-SA
website at
 <font color="#0000ff"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2"><span
style="text-decoration: none"><a class="western" href=
"http://standards.ieee.org/about/sasb/patcom/patents.html">http://standards.ieee.org/about/sasb/patcom/patents.html</a></span></font></font></font>.
Letters of Assurance may indicate whether the Submitter is willing or
unwilling to grant licenses under patent rights without compenstation
or under reasonable rates, with reasonable terms and conditions that are demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination to applicants
desiring to obtain such licenses.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-top: 0.07cm; margin-bottom: 0.07cm"><font size="2">Essential Patent Claims may exist for which a
Letter of Assurance has not been received.
The IEEE and The Open Group are not responsible for identifying Essential Patent Claims for which a license may be required, for
conducting inquiries into the legal validity or scope of Patents Claims, or determining whether any licensing terms or conditions
are reasonable or non-discriminatory. Users of this standard are expressly advised that determination of the validity of any patent
rights, and the risk of infringement of such rights, is entirely their own responsibility. Further information may be obtained from the IEEE Standards Association and The Open
Group.</font></p>
