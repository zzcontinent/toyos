<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-top: 0.07cm; margin-bottom: 0.07cm; border: 1px solid #000000; padding: 0.04cm 0.14cm"><a name=

Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX).</font></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-top: 0.07cm; margin-bottom: 0.07cm"><a name="pgfId-1007026"></a> <font size="2">This standard was
developed, and is maintained, by a joint working group of members of the IEEE Portable Applications Standards Committee, members of
The Open Group, and members of ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee&nbsp;1. This joint working group is known as the Austin
Group.<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote2anc" href="#sdfootnote2sym"><sup>B</sup></a></sup></font></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-top: 0.07cm; margin-bottom: 0.07cm"><font size="2">The Austin Group arose out of discussions
amongst the parties which started in early 1998, leading to an initial meeting and formation of the group in September 1998. The
purpose of the Austin Group is to develop and maintain the core open systems interfaces that are the POSIX<sup>&reg;</sup> 1003.1
(and former 1003.2) standards, ISO/IEC 9945, and the core of the Single UNIX Specification.</font></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-top: 0.07cm; margin-bottom: 0.07cm"><font size="2">The approach to specification development has
been one of &ldquo;write once, adopt everywhere&rdquo;, with the deliverables being a set of specifications that carry the IEEE
POSIX designation, The Open Group's Technical Standard designation, and an ISO/IEC designation.</font></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-top: 0.07cm; margin-bottom: 0.07cm"><font size="2">This unique development has combined both the
industry-led efforts and the formal standardization activities into a single initiative, and included a wide spectrum of
participants. The Austin Group continues as the maintenance body for this document.</font></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-top: 0.07cm; margin-bottom: 0.07cm"><font size="2">Anyone wishing to participate in the Austin
Group should contact the chair with their request. There are no fees for participation or membership. You may participate as an
observer or as a contributor. You do not have to attend face-to-face meetings to participate; electronic participation is most
welcome. For more information on the Austin Group and how to participate, see <font color="#0000ff"><font face=

<h5>Background</h5>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-top: 0.07cm; margin-bottom: 0.07cm"><font size="2">The developers of POSIX.1-2017 represent a
cross-section of hardware manufacturers, vendors of operating systems and other software development tools, software designers,
consultants, academics, authors, applications programmers, and others.</font></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-top: 0.07cm; margin-bottom: 0.07cm"><font size="2">Conceptually, POSIX.1-2017 describes a set of
fundamental services needed for the efficient construction of application programs. Access to these services has been provided by
defining an interface, using the C programming language, a command interpreter, and common utility programs that establish standard
semantics and syntax. Since this interface enables application developers to write portable applications &ndash; it was developed
with that goal in mind &ndash; it has been designated POSIX<sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote3anc" href=
"#sdfootnote3sym"><sup>C</sup></a></sup>, an acronym for Portable Operating System Interface.</font></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-top: 0.07cm; margin-bottom: 0.07cm"><font size="2">Although originated to refer to the original
IEEE Std 1003.1-1988, the name POSIX more correctly refers to a <i>family</i> of related standards: IEEE Std 1003.<i>n</i> and the
parts of ISO/IEC 9945. In earlier editions of the IEEE standard, the term POSIX was used as a synonym for IEEE Std 1003.1-1988. A
preferred term, POSIX.1, emerged. This maintained the advantages of readability of the symbol &ldquo;POSIX&rdquo; without being
ambiguous with the POSIX family of standards.</font></p>

<h5>Audience</h5>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-top: 0.07cm; margin-bottom: 0.07cm"><font size="2">The intended audience for POSIX.1-2017 is all
persons concerned with an industry-wide standard operating system based on the UNIX system. This includes at least four groups of
people:</font></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p align="LEFT" style="margin-top: 0.04cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="2">Persons buying hardware and software
systems</font></p>
</li>

<li>
<p align="LEFT" style="margin-top: 0.04cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="2">Persons managing companies that are deciding on
future corporate computing directions</font></p>
</li>

<li>
<p align="LEFT" style="margin-top: 0.04cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="2">Persons implementing operating systems, and
especially</font></p>
</li>

<li>
<p align="LEFT" style="margin-top: 0.04cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="2">Persons developing applications where portability is
an objective</font></p>
</li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-top: 0.28cm; margin-bottom: 0.07cm; page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><font face=
"Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt"><b>Purpose</b></font></font></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-top: 0.07cm; margin-bottom: 0.07cm"><font size="2">Several principles guided the development of
POSIX.1-2017:</font></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p align="LEFT" style="margin-top: 0.04cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="2">Application-Oriented &ndash; The basic goal was to
promote portability of application programs across UNIX system environments by developing a clear, consistent, and unambiguous
standard for the interface specification of a portable operating system based on the UNIX system documentation. POSIX.1-2017
codifies the common, existing definition of the UNIX system.</font></p>
</li>

<li>
<p align="LEFT" style="margin-top: 0.04cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="2">Interface, Not Implementation &ndash; POSIX.1-2017
defines an interface, not an implementation. No distinction is made between library functions and system calls; both are referred
to as functions. No details of the implementation of any function are given (although historical practice is sometimes indicated in
the RATIONALE section). Symbolic names are given for constants (such as signals and error numbers) rather than numbers.</font></p>
</li>

<li>
<p align="LEFT" style="margin-top: 0.04cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="2">Source, Not Object, Portability &ndash; POSIX.1-2017
has been written so that a program written and translated for execution on one conforming implementation may also be translated for
execution on another conforming implementation. POSIX.1-2017 does not guarantee that executable (object or binary) code will
execute under a different conforming implementation than that for which it was translated, even if the underlying hardware is
identical.</font></p>
</li>

<li>
<p align="LEFT" style="margin-top: 0.04cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="2">The C Language &ndash; The system interfaces and
header definitions are written in terms of the standard C language as specified in the ISO C standard.</font></p>
</li>

<li>
<p align="LEFT" style="margin-top: 0.04cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="2">No Superuser, No System Administration &ndash; There
was no intention to specify all aspects of an operating system. System administration facilities and functions are excluded from
this standard, and functions usable only by the superuser have not been included. Still, an implementation of the standard
interface may also implement features not in POSIX.1-2017. POSIX.1-2017 is also not concerned with hardware constraints or system
maintenance.</font></p>
</li>

<li>
<p align="LEFT" style="margin-top: 0.04cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="2">Minimal Interface, Minimally Defined &ndash; In
keeping with the historical design principles of the UNIX system, the mandatory core facilities of POSIX.1-2017 have been kept as
minimal as possible. Additional capabilities have been added as optional extensions.</font></p>
</li>

<li>
<p align="LEFT" style="margin-top: 0.04cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="2">Broadly Implementable &ndash; The developers of
POSIX.1-2017 endeavored to make all specified functions implementable across a wide range of existing and potential systems,
including:</font></p>
</li>
</ul>

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<ul>
<li>
<p align="LEFT" style="margin-top: 0.04cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="2">All of the current major systems that are ultimately
derived from the original UNIX system code (Version 7 or later)</font></p>
</li>

<li>
<p align="LEFT" style="margin-top: 0.04cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="2">Compatible systems that are not derived from the
original UNIX system code</font></p>
</li>

<li>
<p align="LEFT" style="margin-top: 0.04cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="2">Emulations hosted on entirely different operating
systems</font></p>
</li>

<li>
<p align="LEFT" style="margin-top: 0.04cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="2">Networked systems</font></p>
</li>

<li>
<p align="LEFT" style="margin-top: 0.04cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="2">Distributed systems</font></p>
</li>

<li>
<p align="LEFT" style="margin-top: 0.04cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="2">Systems running on a broad range of
hardware</font></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-left: 1cm; margin-top: 0.14cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="2">No direct references to this
goal appear in POSIX.1-2017, but some results of it are mentioned in the Rationale (Informative) volume.</font></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p align="LEFT" style="margin-top: 0.04cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="2">Minimal Changes to Historical Implementations &ndash;
When the original version &ndash; IEEE Std 1003.1-1988 &ndash; was published, there were no known historical implementations that
did not have to change. However, there was a broad consensus on a set of functions, types, definitions, and concepts that formed an
interface that was common to most historical implementations.</font></p>
</li>
</ul>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-left: 1cm; margin-top: 0.14cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="2">The adoption of the 1988 and
1990 IEEE system interface standards, the 1992 IEEE shell and utilities standard, the various Open Group (formerly X/Open)
specifications, and IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 and its technical corrigenda have consolidated this consensus, and this version reflects
the significantly increased level of consensus arrived at since the original versions. The authors of the original versions tried,
as much as possible, to follow the principles below when creating new specifications:</font></p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<ul>
<li>
<p align="LEFT" style="margin-top: 0.04cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="2">By standardizing an interface like one in an
historical implementation; for example, directories</font></p>
</li>

<li>
<p align="LEFT" style="margin-top: 0.04cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="2">By specifying an interface that is readily
implementable in terms of, and backwards-compatible with, historical implementations, such as the extended <i>tar</i> format
defined in the <i>pax</i> utility</font></p>
</li>

<li>
<p align="LEFT" style="margin-top: 0.04cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="2">By specifying an interface that, when added to an
historical implementation, will not conflict with it; for example, the <i>sigaction</i>() function</font></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-left: 1cm; margin-top: 0.14cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="2">POSIX.1-2017 is specifically not
a codification of a particular vendor's product.</font></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-left: 1cm; margin-top: 0.14cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="2">It should be noted that
implementations will have different kinds of extensions. Some will reflect &ldquo;historical usage&rdquo; and will be preserved for
execution of pre-existing applications. These functions should be considered &ldquo;obsolescent&rdquo; and the standard functions
used for new applications. Some extensions will represent functions beyond the scope of POSIX.1-2017. These need to be used with
careful management to be able to adapt to future extensions of POSIX.1-2017 and/or port to implementations that provide these
services in a different manner.</font></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p align="LEFT" style="margin-top: 0.04cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="2">Minimal Changes to Existing Application Code &ndash;
A goal of POSIX.1-2017 was to minimize additional work for application developers. However, because every known historical
implementation will have to change at least slightly to conform, some applications will have to change.</font></p>
</li>
</ul>

<h5>POSIX.1-2017</h5>
