</ul>

<h3><a name="tag_24_01">   D.1  </a>User Requirements</h3>

<p>This section describes the user requirements that were perceived by the standard developers. The primary source for these
requirements was an analysis of historical practice in widespread use, as typified by the base documents for the
ISO&nbsp;POSIX-1:1996 standard.</p>

<p>POSIX.1-2017 addresses the needs of users requiring open systems solutions for source code portability of applications. It
currently addresses users requiring open systems solutions for source-code portability of applications involving multi-programming
and process management (creating processes, signaling, and so on); access to files and directories in a hierarchy of file systems
(opening, reading, writing, deleting files, and so on); access to asynchronous communications ports and other special devices;
access to information about other users of the system; facilities supporting applications requiring bounded (realtime)
response.</p>

<p>The following users are identified for POSIX.1-2017:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Those employing applications written in high-level languages, such as C, Ada, or FORTRAN.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Users who desire conforming applications that do not necessarily require the characteristics of high-level languages (for
example, the speed of execution of compiled languages or the relative security of source code intellectual property inherent in the
compilation process).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Users who desire conforming applications that can be developed quickly and can be modified readily without the use of compilers
and other system components that may be unavailable on small systems or those without special application development
capabilities.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Users who interact with a system to achieve general-purpose time-sharing capabilities common to most business or government
offices or academic environments: editing, filing, inter-user communications, printing, and so on.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Users who develop applications for POSIX-conformant systems.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Users who develop applications for UNIX systems.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>An acknowledged restriction on applicable users is that they are limited to the group of individuals who are familiar with the
style of interaction characteristic of historically-derived systems based on one of the UNIX operating systems (as opposed to other
historical systems with different models, such as MS/DOS, Macintosh, VMS, MVS, and so on). Typical users would include program
developers, engineers, or general-purpose time-sharing users.</p>

<p>The requirements of users of POSIX.1-2017 can be summarized as a single goal: <i>application source portability</i>. The
requirements of the user are stated in terms of the requirements of portability of applications. This in turn becomes a requirement
for a standardized set of syntax and semantics for operations commonly found on many operating systems.</p>

<p>The following sections list the perceived requirements for application portability.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_24_01_01">  D.1.1  </a>Configuration Interrogation</h4>

<p>An application must be able to determine whether and how certain optional features are provided and to identify the system upon
which it is running, so that it may appropriately adapt to its environment.</p>

<p>Applications must have sufficient information to adapt to varying behaviors of the system.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_24_01_02">  D.1.2  </a>Process Management</h4>

<p>An application must be able to manage itself, either as a single process or as multiple processes. Applications must be able to
manage other processes when appropriate.</p>

<p>Applications must be able to identify, control, create, and delete processes, and there must be communication of information
between processes and to and from the system.</p>

<p>Applications must be able to use multiple flows of control with a process (threads) and synchronize operations between these
flows of control.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_24_01_03">  D.1.3  </a>Access to Data</h4>

<p>Applications must be able to operate on the data stored on the system, access it, and transmit it to other applications.
Information must have protection from unauthorized or accidental access or modification.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_24_01_04">  D.1.4  </a>Access to the Environment</h4>

<p>Applications must be able to access the external environment to communicate their input and results.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_24_01_05">  D.1.5  </a>Access to Determinism and Performance Enhancements</h4>

<p>Applications must have sufficient control of resource allocation to ensure the timeliness of interactions with external
objects.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_24_01_06">  D.1.6  </a>Operating System-Dependent Profile</h4>

<p>The capabilities of the operating system may make certain optional characteristics of the base language in effect no longer
optional, and this should be specified.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_24_01_07">  D.1.7  </a>I/O Interaction</h4>

<p>The interaction between the C language I/O subsystem (<i>stdio</i>) and the I/O subsystem of POSIX.1-2017 must be
specified.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_24_01_08">  D.1.8  </a>Internationalization Interaction</h4>

<p>The effects of the environment of POSIX.1-2017 on the internationalization facilities of the C language must be specified.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_24_01_09">  D.1.9  </a>C-Language Extensions</h4>

<p>Certain functions in the C language must be extended to support the additional capabilities provided by POSIX.1-2017.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_24_01_10">  D.1.10  </a>Command Language</h4>

<p>Users should be able to define procedures that combine simple tools and/or applications into higher-level components that
perform to the specific needs of the user. The user should be able to store, recall, use, and modify these procedures. These
procedures should employ a powerful command language that is used for recurring tasks in conforming applications (scripts) in the
same way that it is used interactively to accomplish one-time tasks. The language and the utilities that it uses must be consistent
between systems to reduce errors and retraining.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_24_01_11">  D.1.11  </a>Interactive Facilities</h4>

<p>Use the system to accomplish individual tasks at an interactive terminal. The interface should be consistent, intuitive, and
offer usability enhancements to increase the productivity of terminal users, reduce errors, and minimize retraining costs. Online
documentation or usage assistance should be available.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_24_01_12">  D.1.12  </a>Accomplish Multiple Tasks Simultaneously</h4>

<p>Access applications and interactive facilities from a single terminal without requiring serial execution: switch between
multiple interactive tasks; schedule one-time or periodic background work; display the status of all work in progress or scheduled;
influence the priority scheduling of work, when authorized.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_24_01_13">  D.1.13  </a>Complex Data Manipulation</h4>

<p>Manipulate data in files in complex ways: sort, merge, compare, translate, edit, format, pattern match, select subsets (strings,
columns, fields, rows, and so on). These facilities should be available to both conforming applications and interactive users.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_24_01_14">  D.1.14  </a>File Hierarchy Manipulation</h4>

<p>Create, delete, move/rename, copy, backup/archive, and display files and directories. These facilities should be available to
both conforming applications and interactive users.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_24_01_15">  D.1.15  </a>Locale Configuration</h4>

<p>Customize applications and interactive sessions for the cultural and language conventions of the user. Employ a wide variety of
standard character encodings. These facilities should be available to both conforming applications and interactive users.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_24_01_16">  D.1.16  </a>Inter-User Communication</h4>

<p>Send messages or transfer files to other users on the same system or other systems on a network. These facilities should be
available to both conforming applications and interactive users.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_24_01_17">  D.1.17  </a>System Environment</h4>

<p>Display information about the status of the system (activities of users and their interactive and background work, file system
utilization, system time, configuration, and presence of optional facilities) and the environment of the user (terminal
characteristics, and so on). Inform the system operator/administrator of problems. Control access to user files and other
resources.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_24_01_18">  D.1.18  </a>Printing</h4>

<p>Output files on a variety of output device classes, accessing devices on local or network-connected systems. Control (or
influence) the formatting, priority scheduling, and output distribution of work. These facilities should be available to both
conforming applications and interactive users.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_24_01_19">  D.1.19  </a>Software Development</h4>

<p>Develop (create and manage source files, compile/interpret, debug) portable open systems applications and package them for
distribution to, and updating of, other systems.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_24_02_01">  D.2.1  </a>Configuration Interrogation</h4>

<p>The <a href="../functions/uname.html"><i>uname</i>()</a> operation provides basic identification of the system. The <a href=
"../functions/sysconf.html"><i>sysconf</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/pathconf.html"><i>pathconf</i>()</a>, and <a href=
"../functions/fpathconf.html"><i>fpathconf</i>()</a> functions and the <a href="../utilities/getconf.html"><i>getconf</i></a>
utility provide means to interrogate the implementation to determine how to adapt to the environment in which it is running. These
values can be either static (indicating that all instances of the implementation have the same value) or dynamic (indicating that
different instances of the implementation have the different values, or that the value may vary for other reasons, such as
reconfiguration).</p>

<h5><a name="tag_24_02_01_01"></a>Unsatisfied Requirements</h5>

<p>None directly. However, as new areas are added, there will be a need for additional capability in this area.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_24_02_02">  D.2.2  </a>Process Management</h4>

<p>The <a href="../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a>, <i>exec</i> family, <a href=
"../functions/posix_spawn.html"><i>posix_spawn</i>()</a>, and <a href="../functions/posix_spawnp.html"><i>posix_spawnp</i>()</a>
functions provide for the creation of new processes or the insertion of new applications into existing processes. The <a href=
"../functions/_Exit.html"><i>_Exit</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/_exit.html"><i>_exit</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/exit.html"><i>exit</i>()</a>, and <a href="../functions/abort.html"><i>abort</i>()</a> functions allow for the
termination of a process by itself. The <a href="../functions/wait.html"><i>wait</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/waitid.html"><i>waitid</i>()</a>, and <a href="../functions/waitpid.html"><i>waitpid</i>()</a> functions allow one
process to deal with the termination of another.</p>

<p>The <a href="../functions/times.html"><i>times</i>()</a> function allows for basic measurement of times used by a process.
Various functions, including <a href="../functions/fstat.html"><i>fstat</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/getegid.html"><i>getegid</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/geteuid.html"><i>geteuid</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/getgid.html"><i>getgid</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/getgrgid.html"><i>getgrgid</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/getgrnam.html"><i>getgrnam</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/getlogin.html"><i>getlogin</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/getpid.html"><i>getpid</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/getppid.html"><i>getppid</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/getpwnam.html"><i>getpwnam</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/getpwuid.html"><i>getpwuid</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/getuid.html"><i>getuid</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/lstat.html"><i>lstat</i>()</a>, and <a href=
"../functions/stat.html"><i>stat</i>()</a>, provide for access to the identifiers of processes and the identifiers and names of
owners of processes (and files).</p>

<p>The various functions operating on environment variables provide for communication of information (primarily user-configurable
defaults) from a parent to child processes.</p>

<p>The operations on the current working directory control and interrogate the directory from which relative pathname searches
start. The <a href="../functions/umask.html"><i>umask</i>()</a> function controls the default protections applied to files created
by the process.</p>

<p>The <a href="../functions/alarm.html"><i>alarm</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/pause.html"><i>pause</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/sleep.html"><i>sleep</i>()</a>, <i>ualarm</i>(), and <i>usleep</i>() operations allow the process to suspend until a
timer has expired or to be notified when a period of time has elapsed. The <a href="../functions/time.html"><i>time</i>()</a>
operation interrogates the current time and date.</p>

<p>The signal mechanism provides for communication of events either from other processes or from the environment to the
application, and the means for the application to control the effect of these events. The mechanism provides for external
termination of a process and for a process to suspend until an event occurs. The mechanism also provides for a value to be
associated with an event.</p>

<p>Job control provides a means to group processes and control them as groups, and to control their access to the function between
the user and the system (the &quot;controlling terminal&quot;). It also provides the means to suspend and resume processes.</p>

<p>The Process Scheduling option provides control of the scheduling and priority of a process.</p>

<p>The Message Passing option provides a means for interprocess communication involving small amounts of data.</p>

<p>The Memory Management facilities provide control of memory resources and for the sharing of memory. This functionality is
mandatory on POSIX-conforming systems.</p>

<p>The Threads facilities provide multiple flows of control with a process (threads), synchronization between threads (including
mutexes, barriers, and spin locks), association of data with threads, and controlled cancellation of threads.</p>

<p>The XSI interprocess communications functionality provide an alternate set of facilities to manipulate semaphores, message
queues, and shared memory. These are provided on XSI-conformant systems to support conforming applications developed to run on UNIX
systems.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_24_02_03">  D.2.3  </a>Access to Data</h4>

<p>The <a href="../functions/open.html"><i>open</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/close.html"><i>close</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/fclose.html"><i>fclose</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/fopen.html"><i>fopen</i>()</a>, and <a href=
"../functions/pipe.html"><i>pipe</i>()</a> functions provide for access to files and data. Such files may be regular files,
interprocess data channels (pipes), or devices. Additional types of objects in the file system are permitted and are being
contemplated for standardization.</p>

<p>The <a href="../functions/access.html"><i>access</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/chmod.html"><i>chmod</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/chown.html"><i>chown</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/dup.html"><i>dup</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/dup2.html"><i>dup2</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/fchmod.html"><i>fchmod</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/fcntl.html"><i>fcntl</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/fstat.html"><i>fstat</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/ftruncate.html"><i>ftruncate</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/lstat.html"><i>lstat</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/readlink.html"><i>readlink</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/realpath.html"><i>realpath</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/stat.html"><i>stat</i>()</a>, and <a href="../functions/utime.html"><i>utime</i>()</a> functions allow for control
and interrogation of file and file-related objects (including symbolic links), and their ownership, protections, and
timestamps.</p>

<p>The <a href="../functions/fgetc.html"><i>fgetc</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/fputc.html"><i>fputc</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/fread.html"><i>fread</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/fseek.html"><i>fseek</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/fsetpos.html"><i>fsetpos</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/fwrite.html"><i>fwrite</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/getc.html"><i>getc</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/getchar.html"><i>getchar</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/lseek.html"><i>lseek</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/putchar.html"><i>putchar</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/putc.html"><i>putc</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a>, and <a href=
"../functions/write.html"><i>write</i>()</a> functions provide for data transfer from the application to files (in all their
forms).</p>

<p>The <a href="../functions/closedir.html"><i>closedir</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/link.html"><i>link</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/mkdir.html"><i>mkdir</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/opendir.html"><i>opendir</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/readdir.html"><i>readdir</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/rename.html"><i>rename</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/rmdir.html"><i>rmdir</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/rewinddir.html"><i>rewinddir</i>()</a>, and <a href=
"../functions/unlink.html"><i>unlink</i>()</a> functions provide for a complete set of operations on directories. Directories can
arbitrarily contain other directories, and a single file can be mentioned in more than one directory.</p>

<p>The <a href="../functions/faccessat.html"><i>faccessat</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/openat.html"><i>openat</i>()</a>, <a
href="../functions/fchmodat.html"><i>fchmodat</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/fchownat.html"><i>fchownat</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/fstatat.html"><i>fstatat</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/linkat.html"><i>linkat</i>()</a> <a href=
"../functions/renameat.html"><i>renameat</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/readlinkat.html"><i>readlinkat</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/sylimkat.html"><i>sylimkat</i>()</a>, and <a href="../functions/unlinkat.html"><i>unlinkat</i>()</a> functions allow
for race-free and thread-safe file access. The motivation for the introduction of these functions was as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Interfaces taking a pathname may be limited by the maximum length of a pathname ( {PATH_MAX}). The absolute path of files can
far exceed this length. The alternative solution of changing the working directory and using relative pathnames is not
thread-safe.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A second motivation is that files accessed outside the current working directory are subject to attacks caused by the race
condition created by changing any of the elements of the pathnames used.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A third motivation is to allow application code which makes use of a virtual current working directory for each individual
thread. In the alternative model there is only one current working directory for all threads.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The file-locking mechanism provides for advisory locking (protection during transactions) of ranges of bytes (in effect,
records) in a file.</p>

<p>The <a href="../functions/confstr.html"><i>confstr</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/fpathconf.html"><i>fpathconf</i>()</a>, <a
href="../functions/pathconf.html"><i>pathconf</i>()</a>, and <a href="../functions/sysconf.html"><i>sysconf</i>()</a> functions
provide for enquiry as to the behavior of the system where variability is permitted.</p>

<p>The asynchronous input and output functions <a href="../functions/aio_cancel.html"><i>aio_cancel</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/aio_error.html"><i>aio_error</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/aio_fsync.html"><i>aio_fsync</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/aio_read.html"><i>aio_read</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/aio_return.html"><i>aio_return</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/aio_suspend.html"><i>aio_suspend</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/aio_write.html"><i>aio_write</i>()</a>, and <a
href="../functions/lio_listio.html"><i>lio_listio</i>()</a> provide for initiation and control of asynchronous data transfers.</p>

<p>The Synchronized Input and Output option provides for assured commitment of data to media.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_24_02_04">  D.2.4  </a>Access to the Environment</h4>

<p>The operations and types in XBD are provided for access to asynchronous serial devices. The primary intended use for these is
the controlling terminal for the application (the interaction point between the user and the system). They are general enough to be
used to control any asynchronous serial device. The functions are also general enough to be used with many other device types as a
user interface when some emulation is provided.</p>

<p>Less detailed access is provided for other device types, but in many instances an application need not know whether an object in
the file system is a device or a regular file to operate correctly.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_24_02_04_01"></a>Unsatisfied Requirements</h5>

<p>Detailed control of common device classes, specifically magnetic tape, is not provided.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_24_02_05">  D.2.5  </a>Bounded (Realtime) Response</h4>

<p>The realtime signal functions <a href="../functions/sigqueue.html"><i>sigqueue</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/sigtimedwait.html"><i>sigtimedwait</i>()</a>, and <a href="../functions/sigwaitinfo.html"><i>sigwaitinfo</i>()</a>
provide queued signals and the prioritization of the handling of signals.</p>

<p>The SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_SPORADIC, and SCHED_RR scheduling policies provide control over processor allocation.</p>

<p>The semaphore functions <a href="../functions/sem_close.html"><i>sem_close</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/sem_destroy.html"><i>sem_destroy</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/sem_getvalue.html"><i>sem_getvalue</i>()</a>, <a
href="../functions/sem_init.html"><i>sem_init</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/sem_open.html"><i>sem_open</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/sem_post.html"><i>sem_post</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/sem_timedwait.html"><i>sem_timedwait</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/sem_trywait.html"><i>sem_trywait</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/sem_unlink.html"><i>sem_unlink</i>()</a>, and <a
href="../functions/sem_wait.html"><i>sem_wait</i>()</a> provide high-performance synchronization.</p>

<p>The memory management functions provide memory locking for control of memory allocation, file mapping for high performance, and
shared memory for high-performance interprocess communication. The Message Passing option provides for interprocess communication
without being dependent on shared memory.</p>

<p>The timers functions <a href="../functions/clock_getres.html"><i>clock_getres</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/clock_gettime.html"><i>clock_gettime</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/clock_settime.html"><i>clock_settime</i>()</a>,
<a href="../functions/nanosleep.html"><i>nanosleep</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/timer_create.html"><i>timer_create</i>()</a>,
<a href="../functions/timer_delete.html"><i>timer_delete</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/timer_getoverrun.html"><i>timer_getoverrun</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/timer_gettime.html"><i>timer_gettime</i>()</a>, and <a href=
"../functions/timer_settime.html"><i>timer_settime</i>()</a> provide functionality to manipulate clocks and timers and include a
high resolution function called <a href="../functions/nanosleep.html"><i>nanosleep</i>()</a> with a finer resolution than the <a
href="../functions/sleep.html"><i>sleep</i>()</a> function.</p>

<p>The timeout functions - <a href="../functions/pthread_mutex_timedlock.html"><i>pthread_mutex_timedlock</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/pthread_rwlock_timedrdlock.html"><i>pthread_rwlock_timedrdlock</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock.html"><i>pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock</i>()</a>, and <a href=
"../functions/sem_timedwait.html"><i>sem_timedwait</i>()</a> - the Typed Memory Objects option and the Monotonic Clock option
provide further facilities for applications to use to obtain predictable bounded response.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_24_02_06">  D.2.6  </a>Operating System-Dependent Profile</h4>

<p>POSIX.1-2017 makes no distinction between text and binary files. The values of EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE are further

<h4><a name="tag_24_02_10">  D.2.10  </a>Command Language</h4>

<p>The shell command language, as described in XCU <a href="../utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18"><i>Shell Command Language</i></a>,
is a common language useful in batch scripts, through an API to high-level languages (for the C-Language Binding option, <a href=
"../functions/system.html"><i>system</i>()</a> and <a href="../functions/popen.html"><i>popen</i>()</a>) and through an interactive
terminal (see the <a href="../utilities/sh.html"><i>sh</i></a> utility). The shell language has many of the characteristics of a
high-level language, but it has been designed to be more suitable for user terminal entry and includes interactive debugging
facilities. Through the use of pipelining, many complex commands can be constructed from combinations of data filters and other
common components. Shell scripts can be created, stored, recalled, and modified by the user with simple editors.</p>

<p>In addition to the basic shell language, the following utilities offer features that simplify and enhance programmatic access to
the utilities and provide features normally found only in high-level languages: <a href=
"../utilities/basename.html"><i>basename</i></a>, <a href="../utilities/bc.html"><i>bc</i></a>, <a href=

<h5><a name="tag_24_02_10_01"></a>Unsatisfied Requirements</h5>

<p>None.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_24_02_11">  D.2.11  </a>Interactive Facilities</h4>

<p>The utilities offer a common style of command-line interface through conformance to the Utility Syntax Guidelines (see XBD <a

<h5><a name="tag_24_02_11_01"></a>Unsatisfied Requirements</h5>

<p>The command line interface to individual utilities is as intuitive and consistent as historical practice allows. Work underway

<h4><a name="tag_24_02_20">  D.2.20  </a>Future Growth</h4>

<p>It is arguable whether or not all functionality to support applications is potentially within the scope of POSIX.1-2017. As a
simple matter of practicality, it cannot be. Areas such as graphics, application domain-specific functionality, windowing, and so
on, should be in unique standards. As such, they are properly &quot;Unsatisfied Requirements&quot; in terms of providing fully conforming
applications, but ones which are outside the scope of POSIX.1-2017.</p>

<p>However, as the standards evolve, certain functionality once considered &quot;exotic&quot; enough to be part of a separate standard
become common enough to be included in a core standard such as this. Realtime and networking, for example, have both moved from
separate standards (with much difficult cross-referencing) into this standard over time, and although no specific areas have been
identified for inclusion in a future version, such inclusions seem likely.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_24_03">   D.3  </a>Profiling Considerations</h3>

<p>This section offers guidance to writers of profiles on how the configurable options, limits, and optional behavior of
POSIX.1-2017 should be cited in profiles. Profile writers should consult the general guidance in POSIX.0 when writing POSIX
Standardized Profiles.</p>

<p>The information in this section is an inclusive list of features that should be considered by profile writers. Subsetting of
POSIX.1-2017 should follow XBD <a href="../basedefs/V1_chap02.html#tag_02_01_05_01"><i>Subprofiling Considerations</i></a>. A set

<h4><a name="tag_24_03_01">  D.3.1  </a>Configuration Options</h4>

<p>There are two set of options suggested by POSIX.1-2017: those for POSIX-conforming systems and those for X/Open System Interface
(XSI) conformance. The requirements for XSI conformance are documented in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2017 and not
discussed further here, as they superset the POSIX conformance requirements.</p>

<p>There are three broad optional configurations for the Shell and Utilities volume of POSIX.1-2017: basic execution system,
development system, and user portability interactive system. The options to support these, and other minor configuration options,
are listed in XBD <a href="../basedefs/V1_chap02.html#tag_02"><i>Conformance</i></a>. Profile writers should consult the following
list and the comments concerning user requirements addressed by various components in <a href="#tag_24_02">Portability
Capabilities</a>.</p>

<dl compact>
<dt>POSIX2_UPE</dt>

<dd>
The system supports the User Portability Utilities option. 

<p>This option is a requirement for a user portability interactive system. It is required frequently except for those systems, such
as embedded realtime or dedicated application systems, that support little or no interactive time-sharing work by users or
operators. XSI-conformant systems support this option.</p>
</dd>

<dt>POSIX2_SW_DEV</dt>

<dd>
The system supports the Software Development Utilities option. 

<p>This option is required by many systems, even those in which actual software development does not occur. The <a href=
"../utilities/make.html"><i>make</i></a> utility, in particular, is required by many application software packages as they are
installed onto the system. If POSIX2_C_DEV is supported, POSIX2_SW_DEV is almost a mandatory requirement because of <a href=

</dd>

<dt>POSIX2_C_BIND</dt>

<dd>
The system supports the C-Language Bindings option. 

<p>This option is required on some implementations developing complex C applications or on any system installing C applications in
source form that require the functions in this option. The <a href="../functions/system.html"><i>system</i>()</a> and <a href=

supported in part by the hardware architecture.</p>
</dd>

<dt>_POSIX_CHOWN_RESTRICTED</dt>

<dd>
The system restricts the right to &quot;give away&quot; files to other users. It is mandatory that an implementation be able to support
this facility in POSIX.1-2017; however, it is recognized that implementations need not enable the functionality by default. 

<p>Some applications expect that they can change the ownership of files in this way. It is provided where either security or system

The system supports the locking of specific ranges of the address space. 

<p>For applications that have well-defined sections that need to be locked and others that do not, POSIX.1-2017 supports an
optional set of functions to lock or unlock a range of process addresses. The following are two reasons for having a means to lock
down a specific range:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>An asynchronous event handler function that must respond to external events in a deterministic manner such that page faults
cannot be tolerated</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>An input/output &quot;buffer&quot; area that is the target for direct-to-process I/O, and the overhead of implicit locking and unlocking

<h4><a name="tag_24_03_05">  D.3.5  </a>Configurable Limits</h4>

<p>In general, the configurable limits in the <a href="../basedefs/limits.h.html"><i>&lt;limits.h&gt;</i></a> header defined in the
Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2017 have been set to minimal values; many applications or implementations may require larger
values. No profile can cite lower values.</p>

<dl compact>
<dt>{AIO_LISTIO_MAX}</dt>

<dd>
The current minimum is likely to be inadequate for most applications. It is expected that this value will be increased by profiles
requiring support for list input and output operations.</dd>

<dt>{AIO_MAX}</dt>

<dd>
The current minimum is likely to be inadequate for most applications. It is expected that this value will be increased by profiles
requiring support for asynchronous input and output operations.</dd>

<dt>{AIO_PRIO_DELTA_MAX}</dt>

<dd>
The functionality associated with this limit is needed only by sophisticated applications. It is not expected that this limit would
need to be increased under a general-purpose profile.</dd>

<dt>{ARG_MAX}</dt>

<dd>
The current minimum is likely to need to be increased for profiles, particularly as larger amounts of information are passed
through the environment. Many implementations are believed to support larger values.</dd>

<dt>{CHILD_MAX}</dt>

<dd>
The current minimum is suitable only for systems where a single user is not running applications in parallel. It is significantly
too low for any system also requiring windows, and if _POSIX_JOB_CONTROL is specified, it should be raised.</dd>

<dt>{CLOCKRES_MIN}</dt>

<dd>
It is expected that profiles will require a finer granularity clock, perhaps as fine as 1 &micro;s, represented by a value of 1000
for this limit.</dd>

<dt>{DELAYTIMER_MAX}</dt>

<dd>
It is believed that most implementations will provide larger values.</dd>

<dt>{LINK_MAX}</dt>

<dd>
For most applications and usage, the current minimum is adequate. Many implementations have a much larger value, but this should
not be used as a basis for raising the value unless the applications to be used require it.</dd>

<dt>{LOGIN_NAME_MAX}</dt>

<dd>
This is not actually a limit, but an implementation parameter. No profile should impose a requirement on this value.</dd>

<dt>{MAX_CANON}</dt>

<dd>
For most purposes, the current minimum is adequate. Unless high-speed burst serial devices are used, it should be left as is.</dd>

<dt>{MAX_INPUT}</dt>

<dd>
See {MAX_CANON}.</dd>

<dt>{MQ_OPEN_MAX}</dt>

<dd>
The current minimum should be adequate for most profiles.</dd>

<dt>{MQ_PRIO_MAX}</dt>

<dd>
The current minimum corresponds to the required number of process scheduling priorities. Many realtime practitioners believe that
the number of message priority levels ought to be the same as the number of execution scheduling priorities.</dd>

<dt>{NAME_MAX}</dt>

<dd>
Many implementations now support larger values, and many applications and users assume that larger names can be used. Many existing
profiles also specify a larger value. Specifying this value will reduce the number of conforming implementations, although this
might not be a significant consideration over time. Values greater than 255 should not be required.</dd>

<dt>{NGROUPS_MAX}</dt>

<dd>
The value selected will typically be 8 or larger.</dd>

<dt>{OPEN_MAX}</dt>

<dd>
The historically common value for this has been 20. Many implementations support larger values. If applications that use larger
values are anticipated, an appropriate value should be specified.</dd>

<dt>{PAGESIZE}</dt>

<dd>
This is not actually a limit, but an implementation parameter. No profile should impose a requirement on this value.</dd>

<dt>{PATH_MAX}</dt>

<dd>
Historically, the minimum has been either 1024 or indefinite, depending on the implementation. Few applications actually require
values larger than 256, but some users may create file hierarchies that must be accessed with longer paths. This value should only
be changed if there is a clear requirement.</dd>

<dt>{PIPE_BUF}</dt>

<dd>
The current minimum is adequate for most applications. Historically, it has been larger. If applications that write single
transactions larger than this are anticipated, it should be increased. Applications that write lines of text larger than this
probably do not need it increased, as the text line is delimited by a &lt;newline&gt;.</dd>

<dt>{POSIX_VERSION}</dt>

<dd>
This is actually not a limit, but a standard version stamp. Generally, a profile should specify POSIX.1-2017 by a name in the
normative references section, not this value.</dd>

<dt>{PTHREAD_DESTRUCTOR_ITERATIONS}</dt>

<dd>
It is unlikely that applications will need larger values to avoid loss of memory resources.</dd>

<dt>{PTHREAD_KEYS_MAX}</dt>

<dd>
The current value should be adequate for most profiles.</dd>

<dt>{PTHREAD_STACK_MIN}</dt>

<dd>
This should not be treated as an actual limit, but as an implementation parameter. No profile should impose a requirement on this
value.</dd>

<dt>{PTHREAD_THREADS_MAX}</dt>

<dd>
It is believed that most implementations will provide larger values.</dd>

<dt>{RTSIG_MAX}</dt>

<dd>
The current limit was chosen so that the set of POSIX.1 signal numbers can fit within a 32-bit field. It is recognized that most
existing implementations define many more signals than are specified in POSIX.1 and, in fact, many implementations have already
exceeded 32 signals (including the &quot;null signal&quot;). Support of {_POSIX_RTSIG_MAX} additional signals may push some implementations
over the single 32-bit word line, but is unlikely to push any implementations that are already over that line beyond the 64 signal
line.</dd>

<dt>{SEM_NSEMS_MAX}</dt>

<dd>
The current value should be adequate for most profiles.</dd>

<dt>{SEM_VALUE_MAX}</dt>

<dd>
The current value should be adequate for most profiles.</dd>

<dt>{SSIZE_MAX}</dt>

<dd>
This limit reflects fundamental hardware characteristics (the size of an integer), and should not be specified unless it is clearly
required. Extreme care should be taken to assure that any value that might be specified does not unnecessarily eliminate
implementations because of accidents of hardware design.</dd>

<dt>{STREAM_MAX}</dt>

<dd>
This limit is very closely related to {OPEN_MAX}. It should never be larger than {OPEN_MAX}, but could reasonably be smaller for
application areas where most files are not accessed through <i>stdio</i>. Some implementations may limit {STREAM_MAX} to 20 but
allow {OPEN_MAX} to be considerably larger. Such implementations should be allowed for if the applications permit.</dd>

<dt>{TIMER_MAX}</dt>

<dd>
The current limit should be adequate for most profiles, but it may need to be larger for applications with a large number of
asynchronous operations.</dd>

<dt>{TTY_NAME_MAX}</dt>

<dd>
This is not actually a limit, but an implementation parameter. No profile should impose a requirement on this value.</dd>

<dt>{TZNAME_MAX}</dt>

<dd>
The minimum has been historically adequate, but if longer timezone names are anticipated (particularly such values as UTC-1), this
should be increased.</dd>

<h4><a name="tag_24_03_06">  D.3.6  </a>Optional Behavior</h4>

<p>In POSIX.1-2017, there are no instances of the terms unspecified, undefined, implementation-defined, or with the verbs &quot;may''
or &quot;need not&quot;, that the standard developers anticipate or sanction as suitable for profile or test method citation. All of these
are merely warnings to conforming applications to avoid certain areas that can vary from system to system, and even over time on
the same system. In many cases, these terms are used explicitly to support extensions, but profiles should not anticipate and
require such extensions; future versions of this standard may do so.</p>
