Extension to the ISO&nbsp;C standard <img src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border="0"><br>
 The functionality described is an extension to the ISO&nbsp;C standard. Application developers may make use of an extension as it
is supported on all POSIX.1-2017-conforming systems.</p>

<p>With each function or header from the ISO&nbsp;C standard, a statement to the effect that &quot;any conflict is unintentional&quot; is
included. That is intended to refer to a direct conflict. POSIX.1-2017 acts in part as a profile of the ISO&nbsp;C standard, and it
may choose to further constrain behaviors allowed to vary by the ISO&nbsp;C standard. Such limitations and other compatible
differences are not considered conflicts, even if a CX mark is missing. The markings are for information only.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_01_07_02"></a>Margin Code Notation</h4>

<p>Some of the functionality described in POSIX.1-2017 depends on support of more than one option, or independently may depend on
several options. The following notation for margin codes is used to denote the following cases.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_07_02_01"></a>A Feature Dependent on One or Two Options</h5>

<p>In this case, margin codes have a &lt;space&gt; separator; for example:</p>

<p><sup>[<a name="SHM">SHM</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0">
This feature requires support for only the Shared Memory Objects option. <img src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]"
border="0"></p>

<p><sup>[<a name="SHM TYM">SHM TYM</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]"
border="0"> This feature requires support for both the Shared Memory Objects option and the Typed Memory Objects option; that is,
an application which uses this feature is portable only between implementations that provide both options. <img src=
"../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border="0"></p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_07_02_02"></a>A Feature Dependent on Either of the Options Denoted</h5>

<p>In this case, margin codes have a <tt>'|'</tt> separator to denote the logical OR; for example:</p>

<p><sup>[<a name="SHM">SHM|TYM</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border=
"0"> This feature is dependent on support for either the Shared Memory Objects option or the Typed Memory Objects option; that is,
an application which uses this feature is portable between implementations that provide any (or all) of the options. <img src=
"../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border="0"></p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_07_02_03"></a>A Feature Dependent on More than Two Options</h5>

<p>The following shorthand notations are used:</p>

<p><sup>[<a name="MC1">MC1</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0">
The MC1 margin code is shorthand for TPP|TPI|RPP|RPI. Features which are shaded with this margin code require support of either the
Non-Robust Mutex Priority Protection option or the Non-Robust Mutex Priority Inheritance option or the Robust Mutex Priority
Protection option or the Robust Mutex Priority Inheritance option. <img src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border=
"0"></p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_07_02_04"></a>Large Sections Dependent on an Option</h5>

<p>Where large sections of text are dependent on support for an option, a lead-in text block is provided and shaded accordingly;
for example:</p>

<p><sup>[<a name="XSI">XSI</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0">
This section describes extensions to support interprocess communication. The functionality described in this section shall be
provided on implementations that support the XSI option (and the rest of this section is not further marked). <img src=
"../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border="0"></p>
