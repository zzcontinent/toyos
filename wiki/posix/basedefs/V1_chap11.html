<h2><a name="tag_11">  11. </a>General Terminal Interface</h2>

<p>This chapter describes a general terminal interface that shall be provided. It shall be supported on any asynchronous
communications ports if the implementation provides them. It is implementation-defined whether it supports network connections or
synchronous ports, or both.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_11_01">   11.1 </a>Interface Characteristics</h3>

<h4><a name="tag_11_01_01">  11.1.1 </a>Opening a Terminal Device File</h4>

<p>When a terminal device file is opened, it normally causes the thread to wait until a connection is established. In practice,
application programs seldom open these files; they are opened by special programs and become an application's standard input,
output, and error files.</p>

<p>Cases where applications do open a terminal device are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Opening <b>/dev/tty</b>, or the pathname returned by <a href="../functions/ctermid.html"><i>ctermid</i>()</a>, in order to
obtain a file descriptor for the controlling terminal; see <a href="#tag_11_01_03">The Controlling Terminal</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Opening the slave side of a pseudo-terminal; see XSH <a href="../functions/ptsname.html#"><i>ptsname</i></a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Opening a modem or similar piece of equipment connected by a serial line. In this case, the terminal parameters (see <a href=
"#tag_11_02">Parameters that Can be Set</a>) may be initialized to default settings by the implementation in between the last
close of the device by any process and the next open of the device, or they may persist from one use to the next. The terminal
parameters can be set to values that ensure the terminal behaves in a conforming manner by means of the O_TTY_INIT open flag when
opening a terminal device that is not already open in any process, or by executing the <a href=
"../utilities/stty.html"><i>stty</i></a> utility with the operand <b>sane</b>.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>As described in <a href="../functions/open.html"><i>open</i>()</a>, opening a terminal device file with the O_NONBLOCK flag
clear shall cause the thread to block until the terminal device is ready and available. If CLOCAL mode is not set, this means
blocking until a connection is established. If CLOCAL mode is set in the terminal, or the O_NONBLOCK flag is specified in the <a
href="../functions/open.html"><i>open</i>()</a>, the <a href="../functions/open.html"><i>open</i>()</a> function shall return a
file descriptor without waiting for a connection to be established.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_11_01_02">  11.1.2 </a>Process Groups</h4>

<p>A terminal may have a foreground process group associated with it. This foreground process group plays a special role in
handling signal-generating input characters, as discussed in <a href="#tag_11_01_09">Special Characters</a>.</p>

<p>A command interpreter process supporting job control can allocate the terminal to different jobs, or process groups, by placing
related processes in a single process group and associating this process group with the terminal. A terminal's foreground process
group may be set or examined by a process, assuming the permission requirements are met; see <a href=
"../functions/tcgetpgrp.html"><i>tcgetpgrp</i>()</a> and <a href="../functions/tcsetpgrp.html"><i>tcsetpgrp</i>()</a>. The terminal
interface aids in this allocation by restricting access to the terminal by processes that are not in the current process group; see
<a href="#tag_11_01_04">Terminal Access Control</a>.</p>

<p>When there is no longer any process whose process ID or process group ID matches the foreground process group ID, the terminal
shall have no foreground process group. It is unspecified whether the terminal has a foreground process group when there is a
process whose process ID matches the foreground process group ID, but whose process group ID does not. No actions defined in
POSIX.1-2017, other than allocation of a controlling terminal or a successful call to <a href=
"../functions/tcsetpgrp.html"><i>tcsetpgrp</i>()</a>, shall cause a process group to become the foreground process group of the
terminal.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_11_01_03">  11.1.3 </a>The Controlling Terminal</h4>

<p>A terminal may belong to a process as its controlling terminal. Each process of a session that has a controlling terminal has
the same controlling terminal. A terminal may be the controlling terminal for at most one session. The controlling terminal for a
session is allocated by the session leader in an implementation-defined manner. If a session leader has no controlling terminal,
and opens a terminal device file that is not already associated with a session without using the O_NOCTTY option (see <a href=
"../functions/open.html"><i>open</i>()</a>), it is implementation-defined whether the terminal becomes the controlling terminal of
the session leader. If a process which is not a session leader opens a terminal file, or the O_NOCTTY option is used on <a href=
"../functions/open.html"><i>open</i>()</a>, then that terminal shall not become the controlling terminal of the calling process.
When a controlling terminal becomes associated with a session, its foreground process group shall be set to the process group of
the session leader.</p>

<p>The controlling terminal is inherited by a child process during a <a href="../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a> function
call. A process relinquishes its controlling terminal when it creates a new session with the <a href=
"../functions/setsid.html"><i>setsid</i>()</a> function; other processes remaining in the old session that had this terminal as
their controlling terminal continue to have it. Upon the close of the last file descriptor in the system (whether or not it is in
the current session) associated with the controlling terminal, it is unspecified whether all processes that had that terminal as
their controlling terminal cease to have any controlling terminal. Whether and how a session leader can reacquire a controlling
terminal after the controlling terminal has been relinquished in this fashion is unspecified. A process does not relinquish its
controlling terminal simply by closing all of its file descriptors associated with the controlling terminal if other processes
continue to have it open.</p>

<p>When a controlling process terminates, the controlling terminal is dissociated from the current session, allowing it to be
acquired by a new session leader. Subsequent access to the terminal by other processes in the earlier session may be denied, with
attempts to access the terminal treated as if a modem disconnect had been sensed.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_11_01_04">  11.1.4 </a>Terminal Access Control</h4>

<p>If a process is in the foreground process group of its controlling terminal, read operations shall be allowed, as described in
<a href="#tag_11_01_05">Input Processing and Reading Data</a>. Any attempts by a process in a background process group to read
from its controlling terminal cause its process group to be sent a SIGTTIN signal unless one of the following special cases
applies: if the reading process is ignoring the SIGTTIN signal or the reading thread is blocking the SIGTTIN signal, or if the
process group of the reading process is orphaned, the <a href="../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a> shall return -1, with
<i>errno</i> set to [EIO] and no signal shall be sent. The default action of the SIGTTIN signal shall be to stop the process to
which it is sent. See <a href="../basedefs/signal.h.html"><i>&lt;signal.h&gt;</i></a>.</p>

<p>If a process is in the foreground process group of its controlling terminal, write operations shall be allowed as described in
<a href="#tag_11_01_08">Writing Data and Output Processing</a>. Attempts by a process in a background process group to write to
its controlling terminal shall cause the process group to be sent a SIGTTOU signal unless one of the following special cases
applies: if TOSTOP is not set, or if TOSTOP is set and the process is ignoring the SIGTTOU signal or the writing thread is blocking
the SIGTTOU signal, the process is allowed to write to the terminal and the SIGTTOU signal is not sent. If TOSTOP is set, the
process group of the writing process is orphaned, the writing process is not ignoring the SIGTTOU signal, and the writing thread is
not blocking the SIGTTOU signal, the <a href="../functions/write.html"><i>write</i>()</a> shall return -1, with <i>errno</i> set to
[EIO] and no signal shall be sent.</p>

<p>Certain calls that set terminal parameters are treated in the same fashion as <a href=
"../functions/write.html"><i>write</i>()</a>, except that TOSTOP is ignored; that is, the effect is identical to that of terminal
writes when TOSTOP is set (see <a href="#tag_11_02_05">Local Modes</a>, <a href="../functions/tcdrain.html"><i>tcdrain</i>()</a>,
<a href="../functions/tcflow.html"><i>tcflow</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/tcflush.html"><i>tcflush</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/tcsendbreak.html"><i>tcsendbreak</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/tcsetattr.html"><i>tcsetattr</i>()</a>, and <a
href="../functions/tcsetpgrp.html"><i>tcsetpgrp</i>()</a>).</p>

<h4><a name="tag_11_01_05">  11.1.5 </a>Input Processing and Reading Data</h4>

<p>A terminal device associated with a terminal device file may operate in full-duplex mode, so that data may arrive even while
output is occurring. Each terminal device file has an input queue associated with it, into which incoming data is stored by the
system before being read by a process. The system may impose a limit, {MAX_INPUT}, on the number of bytes that may be stored in the
input queue. The behavior of the system when this limit is exceeded is implementation-defined.</p>

<p>Two general kinds of input processing are available, determined by whether the terminal device file is in canonical mode or
non-canonical mode. These modes are described in <a href="#tag_11_01_06">Canonical Mode Input Processing</a> and <a href=
"#tag_11_01_07">Non-Canonical Mode Input Processing</a>. Additionally, input characters are processed according to the
<i>c_iflag</i> (see <a href="#tag_11_02_02">Input Modes</a>) and <i>c_lflag</i> (see <a href="#tag_11_02_05">Local Modes</a>)
fields. Such processing can include ``echoing'', which in general means transmitting input characters immediately back to the
terminal when they are received from the terminal. This is useful for terminals that can operate in full-duplex mode.</p>

<p>The manner in which data is provided to a process reading from a terminal device file is dependent on whether the terminal file
is in canonical or non-canonical mode, and on whether or not the O_NONBLOCK flag is set by <a href=
"../functions/open.html"><i>open</i>()</a> or <a href="../functions/fcntl.html"><i>fcntl</i>()</a>.</p>

<p>If the O_NONBLOCK flag is clear, then the read request shall be blocked until data is available or a signal has been received.
If the O_NONBLOCK flag is set, then the read request shall be completed, without blocking, in one of three ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>If there is enough data available to satisfy the entire request, the <a href="../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a> shall
complete successfully and shall return the number of bytes read.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If there is not enough data available to satisfy the entire request, the <a href="../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a>
shall complete successfully, having read as much data as possible, and shall return the number of bytes it was able to read.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If there is no data available, the <a href="../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a> shall return -1, with <i>errno</i> set to
[EAGAIN].</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>When data is available depends on whether the input processing mode is canonical or non-canonical. <a href=
"#tag_11_01_06">Canonical Mode Input Processing</a> and <a href="#tag_11_01_07">Non-Canonical Mode Input Processing</a> describe
each of these input processing modes.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_11_01_06">  11.1.6 </a>Canonical Mode Input Processing</h4>

<p>In canonical mode input processing, terminal input is processed in units of lines. A line is delimited by a &lt;newline&gt;
character (NL), an end-of-file character (EOF), or an end-of-line (EOL) character. See <a href="#tag_11_01_09">Special
Characters</a> for more information on EOF and EOL. This means that a read request shall not return until an entire line has been
typed or a signal has been received. Also, no matter how many bytes are requested in the <a href=
"../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a> call, at most one line shall be returned. It is not, however, necessary to read a whole
line at once; any number of bytes, even one, may be requested in a <a href="../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a> without
losing information.</p>

<p>If {MAX_CANON} is defined for this terminal device, it shall be a limit on the number of bytes in a line. The behavior of the
system when this limit is exceeded is implementation-defined. If {MAX_CANON} is not defined, there shall be no such limit; see <a
href="../functions/pathconf.html"><i>pathconf</i>()</a>.</p>

<p>Erase and kill processing occur when either of two special characters, the ERASE and KILL characters (see <a href=
"#tag_11_01_09">Special Characters</a>), is received. This processing shall affect data in the input queue that has not yet been
delimited by an NL, EOF, or EOL character. This un-delimited data makes up the current line. The ERASE character shall delete the
last character in the current line, if there is one. The KILL character shall delete all data in the current line, if there is any.
The ERASE and KILL characters shall have no effect if there is no data in the current line. The ERASE and KILL characters
themselves shall not be placed in the input queue.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_11_01_07">  11.1.7 </a>Non-Canonical Mode Input Processing</h4>

<p>In non-canonical mode input processing, input bytes are not assembled into lines, and erase and kill processing shall not occur.
The values of the MIN and TIME members of the <i>c_cc</i> array are used to determine how to process the bytes received.
POSIX.1-2017 does not specify whether the setting of O_NONBLOCK takes precedence over MIN or TIME settings. Therefore, if
O_NONBLOCK is set, <a href="../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a> may return immediately, regardless of the setting of MIN or
TIME. Also, if no data is available, <a href="../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a> may either return 0, or return -1 with
<i>errno</i> set to [EAGAIN].</p>

<p>MIN represents the minimum number of bytes that should be received when the <a href="../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a>
function returns successfully. TIME is a timer of 0.1 second granularity that is used to time out bursty and short-term data
transmissions. If MIN is greater than {MAX_INPUT}, the response to the request is undefined. The four possible values for MIN and
TIME and their interactions are described below.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_11_01_07_01"></a>Case A: MIN&gt;0, TIME&gt;0</h5>

<p>In case A, TIME serves as an inter-byte timer which shall be activated after the first byte is received. Since it is an
inter-byte timer, it shall be reset after a byte is received. The interaction between MIN and TIME is as follows. As soon as one
byte is received, the inter-byte timer shall be started. If MIN bytes are received before the inter-byte timer expires (remember
that the timer is reset upon receipt of each byte), the read shall be satisfied. If the timer expires before MIN bytes are
received, the characters received to that point shall be returned to the user. Note that if TIME expires at least one byte shall be
returned because the timer would not have been enabled unless a byte was received. In this case (MIN&gt;0, TIME&gt;0) the read
shall block until the MIN and TIME mechanisms are activated by the receipt of the first byte, or a signal is received. If data is
in the buffer at the time of the <a href="../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a>, the result shall be as if data has been
received immediately after the <a href="../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a>.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_11_01_07_02"></a>Case B: MIN&gt;0, TIME=0</h5>

<p>In case B, since the value of TIME is zero, the timer plays no role and only MIN is significant. A pending read shall not be
satisfied until MIN bytes are received (that is, the pending read shall block until MIN bytes are received), or a signal is
received. A program that uses case B to read record-based terminal I/O may block indefinitely in the read operation.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_11_01_07_03"></a>Case C: MIN=0, TIME&gt;0</h5>

<p>In case C, since MIN=0, TIME no longer represents an inter-byte timer. It now serves as a read timer that shall be activated as
soon as the <a href="../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a> function is processed. A read shall be satisfied as soon as a single
byte is received or the read timer expires. Note that in case C if the timer expires, no bytes shall be returned. If the timer does
not expire, the only way the read can be satisfied is if a byte is received. If bytes are not received, the read shall not block
indefinitely waiting for a byte; if no byte is received within TIME*0.1 seconds after the read is initiated, the <a href=
"../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a> shall return a value of zero, having read no data. If data is in the buffer at the time
of the <a href="../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a>, the timer shall be started as if data has been received immediately
after the <a href="../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a>.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_11_01_07_04"></a>Case D: MIN=0, TIME=0</h5>

<p>The minimum of either the number of bytes requested or the number of bytes currently available shall be returned without waiting
for more bytes to be input. If no characters are available, <a href="../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a> shall return a value
of zero, having read no data.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_11_01_08">  11.1.8 </a>Writing Data and Output Processing</h4>

<p>When a process writes one or more bytes to a terminal device file, they are processed according to the <i>c_oflag</i> field (see
<a href="#tag_11_02_03">Output Modes</a>). The implementation may provide a buffering mechanism; as such, when a call to <a href=
"../functions/write.html"><i>write</i>()</a> completes, all of the bytes written have been scheduled for transmission to the
device, but the transmission has not necessarily completed. See <a href="../functions/write.html"><i>write</i>()</a> for the
effects of O_NONBLOCK on <a href="../functions/write.html"><i>write</i>()</a>.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_11_01_09">  11.1.9 </a>Special Characters</h4>

<p>Certain characters have special functions on input or output or both. These functions are summarized as follows:</p>

<dl compact>
<dt>INTR</dt>

<dd>Special character on input, which is recognized if the ISIG flag is set. Generates a SIGINT signal which is sent to all
processes in the foreground process group for which the terminal is the controlling terminal. If ISIG is set, the INTR character
shall be discarded when processed.</dd>

<dt>QUIT</dt>

<dd>Special character on input, which is recognized if the ISIG flag is set. Generates a SIGQUIT signal which is sent to all
processes in the foreground process group for which the terminal is the controlling terminal. If ISIG is set, the QUIT character
shall be discarded when processed.</dd>

<dt>ERASE</dt>

<dd>Special character on input, which is recognized if the ICANON flag is set. Erases the last character in the current line; see
<a href="#tag_11_01_06">Canonical Mode Input Processing</a>. It shall not erase beyond the start of a line, as delimited by an NL,
EOF, or EOL character. If ICANON is set, the ERASE character shall be discarded when processed.</dd>

<dt>KILL</dt>

<dd>Special character on input, which is recognized if the ICANON flag is set. Deletes the entire line, as delimited by an NL, EOF,
or EOL character. If ICANON is set, the KILL character shall be discarded when processed.</dd>

<dt>EOF</dt>

<dd>Special character on input, which is recognized if the ICANON flag is set. When received, all the bytes waiting to be read are
immediately passed to the process without waiting for a &lt;newline&gt;, and the EOF is discarded. Thus, if there are no bytes
waiting (that is, the EOF occurred at the beginning of a line), a byte count of zero shall be returned from the <a href=
"../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a>, representing an end-of-file indication. If ICANON is set, the EOF character shall be
discarded when processed.</dd>

<dt>NL</dt>

<dd>Special character on input, which is recognized if the ICANON flag is set. It is the line delimiter &lt;newline&gt;. It cannot
be changed.</dd>

<dt>EOL</dt>

<dd>Special character on input, which is recognized if the ICANON flag is set. It is an additional line delimiter, like NL.</dd>

<dt>SUSP</dt>

<dd>If the ISIG flag is set, receipt of the SUSP character shall cause a SIGTSTP signal to be sent to all processes in the
foreground process group for which the terminal is the controlling terminal, and the SUSP character shall be discarded when
processed.</dd>

<dt>STOP</dt>

<dd>Special character on both input and output, which is recognized if the IXON (output control) or IXOFF (input control) flag is
set. Can be used to suspend output temporarily. It is useful with CRT terminals to prevent output from disappearing before it can
be read. If IXON is set, the STOP character shall be discarded when processed.</dd>

<dt>START</dt>

<dd>Special character on both input and output, which is recognized if the IXON (output control) or IXOFF (input control) flag is
set. Can be used to resume output that has been suspended by a STOP character. If IXON is set, the START character shall be
discarded when processed.</dd>

<dt>CR</dt>

<dd>Special character on input, which is recognized if the ICANON flag is set; it is the &lt;carriage-return&gt; character. When
ICANON and ICRNL are set and IGNCR is not set, this character shall be translated into an NL, and shall have the same effect as an
NL character. It cannot be changed.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The NL and CR characters cannot be changed. It is implementation-defined whether the START and STOP characters can be changed.
The values for INTR, QUIT, ERASE, KILL, EOF, EOL, and SUSP shall be changeable to suit individual tastes. Special character
functions associated with changeable special control characters can be disabled individually.</p>

<p>If two or more special characters have the same value, the function performed when that character is received is undefined.</p>

<p>A special character is recognized not only by its value, but also by its context; for example, an implementation may support
multi-byte sequences that have a meaning different from the meaning of the bytes when considered individually. Implementations may
also support additional single-byte functions. These implementation-defined multi-byte or single-byte functions shall be recognized
only if the IEXTEN flag is set; otherwise, data is received without interpretation, except as required to recognize the special
characters defined in this section.</p>

<p><sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('XSI')">XSI</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0">
If IEXTEN is set, the ERASE, KILL, and EOF characters can be escaped by a preceding &lt;backslash&gt; character, in which case no
special function shall occur. <img src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border="0"></p>

<h4><a name="tag_11_01_10">  11.1.10 </a>Modem Disconnect</h4>

<p>If a modem disconnect is detected by the terminal interface for a controlling terminal, and if CLOCAL is not set in the
<i>c_cflag</i> field for the terminal (see <a href="#tag_11_02_04">Control Modes</a>), the SIGHUP signal shall be sent to the
controlling process for which the terminal is the controlling terminal. Unless other arrangements have been made, this shall cause
the controlling process to terminate (see <a href="../functions/exit.html"><i>exit</i>()</a>). Any subsequent read from the
terminal device shall return the value of zero, indicating end-of-file; see <a href="../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a>.
Thus, processes that read a terminal file and test for end-of-file can terminate appropriately after a disconnect. If the EIO
condition as specified in <a href="../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a> also exists, it is unspecified whether on EOF
condition or [EIO] is returned. Any subsequent <a href="../functions/write.html"><i>write</i>()</a> to the terminal device shall
return -1, with <i>errno</i> set to [EIO], until the device is closed.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_11_01_11">  11.1.11 </a>Closing a Terminal Device File</h4>

<p>The last process to close a terminal device file shall cause any output to be sent to the device and shall cause any input to be
discarded. If HUPCL is set in the control modes and the communications port supports a disconnect function, the terminal device
shall perform a disconnect.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_11_02">   11.2 </a>Parameters that Can be Set</h3>

<h4><a name="tag_11_02_01">  11.2.1 </a>The termios Structure</h4>

<p>Routines that need to control certain terminal I/O characteristics shall do so by using the <b>termios</b> structure as defined
in the <a href="../basedefs/termios.h.html"><i>&lt;termios.h&gt;</i></a> header.</p>

<p>Since the <b>termios</b> structure may include additional members, and the standard members may include both standard and
non-standard modes, the structure should never be initialized directly by the application as this may cause the terminal to behave
in a non-conforming manner. When opening a terminal device (other than a pseudo-terminal) that is not already open in any process,
it should be opened with the O_TTY_INIT flag before initializing the structure using <a href=
"../functions/tcgetattr.html"><i>tcgetattr</i>()</a> to ensure that any non-standard elements of the <b>termios</b> structure are
set to values that result in conforming behavior of the terminal interface.</p>

<p>The members of the <b>termios</b> structure include (but are not limited to):</p>

<p>In the context of asynchronous serial data transmission, a break condition shall be defined as a sequence of zero-valued bits
that continues for more than the time to send one byte. The entire sequence of zero-valued bits is interpreted as a single break
condition, even if it continues for a time equivalent to more than one byte. In contexts other than asynchronous serial data
transmission, the definition of a break condition is implementation-defined.</p>

<p>If IGNBRK is set, a break condition detected on input shall be ignored; that is, not put on the input queue and therefore not
read by any process. If IGNBRK is not set and BRKINT is set, the break condition shall flush the input and output queues, and if
the terminal is the controlling terminal of a foreground process group, the break condition shall generate a single SIGINT signal
to that foreground process group. If neither IGNBRK nor BRKINT is set, a break condition shall be read as a single 0x00, or if
PARMRK is set, as 0xff 0x00 0x00.</p>

<p>If IGNPAR is set, a byte with a framing or parity error (other than break) shall be ignored.</p>

<p>If PARMRK is set, and IGNPAR is not set, a byte with a framing or parity error (other than break) shall be given to the
application as the three-byte sequence 0xff 0x00 X, where 0xff 0x00 is a two-byte flag preceding each sequence and X is the data of
the byte received in error. To avoid ambiguity in this case, if ISTRIP is not set, a valid byte of 0xff is given to the application
as 0xff 0xff. If neither PARMRK nor IGNPAR is set, a framing or parity error (other than break) shall be given to the application
as a single byte 0x00.</p>

<p>If INPCK is set, input parity checking shall be enabled. If INPCK is not set, input parity checking shall be disabled, allowing
output parity generation without input parity errors. Note that whether input parity checking is enabled or disabled is independent
of whether parity detection is enabled or disabled (see <a href="#tag_11_02_04">Control Modes</a>). If parity detection is enabled
but input parity checking is disabled, the hardware to which the terminal is connected shall recognize the parity bit, but the
terminal special file shall not check whether or not this bit is correctly set.</p>

<p>If ISTRIP is set, valid input bytes shall first be stripped to seven bits; otherwise, all eight bits shall be processed.</p>

<p>If INLCR is set, a received NL character shall be translated into a CR character. If IGNCR is set, a received CR character shall
be ignored (not read). If IGNCR is not set and ICRNL is set, a received CR character shall be translated into an NL character.</p>

<p>If IXANY is set, any input character shall restart output that has been suspended.</p>

<p>If IXON is set, start/stop output control shall be enabled. A received STOP character shall suspend output and a received START
character shall restart output. When IXON is set, START and STOP characters are not read, but merely perform flow control
functions. When IXON is not set, the START and STOP characters shall be read.</p>

<p>If IXOFF is set, start/stop input control shall be enabled. The system shall transmit STOP characters, which are intended to
cause the terminal device to stop transmitting data, as needed to prevent the input queue from overflowing and causing
implementation-defined behavior, and shall transmit START characters, which are intended to cause the terminal device to resume
transmitting data, as soon as the device can continue transmitting data without risk of overflowing the input queue. The precise
conditions under which STOP and START characters are transmitted are implementation-defined.</p>

<p>The initial input control value after <a href="../functions/open.html"><i>open</i>()</a> is implementation-defined.</p>

<p>If OPOST is set, output data shall be post-processed as described below, so that lines of text are modified to appear
appropriately on the terminal device; otherwise, characters shall be transmitted without change.</p>

<p><sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('XSI')">XSI</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0">
If ONLCR is set, the NL character shall be transmitted as the CR-NL character pair. If OCRNL is set, the CR character shall be
transmitted as the NL character. If ONOCR is set, no CR character shall be transmitted when at column 0 (first position). If ONLRET
is set, the NL character is assumed to do the carriage-return function; the column pointer shall be set to 0 and the delays
specified for CR shall be used. Otherwise, the NL character is assumed to do just the line-feed function; the column pointer
remains unchanged. The column pointer shall also be set to 0 if the CR character is actually transmitted.</p>

<p>The delay bits specify how long transmission stops to allow for mechanical or other movement when certain characters are sent to
the terminal. In all cases a value of 0 shall indicate no delay. If OFILL is set, fill characters shall be transmitted for delay
instead of a timed delay. This is useful for high baud rate terminals which need only a minimal delay. If OFDEL is set, the fill
character shall be DEL; otherwise, NUL.</p>

<p>If a &lt;form-feed&gt; or &lt;vertical-tab&gt; delay is specified, it shall last for about 2 seconds.</p>

<p>Newline delay shall last about 0.10 seconds. If ONLRET is set, the carriage-return delays shall be used instead of the newline
delays. If OFILL is set, two fill characters shall be transmitted.</p>

<p>Carriage-return delay type 1 shall be dependent on the current column position, type 2 shall be about 0.10 seconds, and type 3
shall be about 0.15 seconds. If OFILL is set, delay type 1 shall transmit two fill characters, and type 2 four fill characters.</p>

<p>Horizontal-tab delay type 1 shall be dependent on the current column position. Type 2 shall be about 0.10 seconds. Type 3
specifies that &lt;tab&gt; characters shall be expanded into &lt;space&gt; characters. If OFILL is set, two fill characters shall
be transmitted for any delay.</p>

<p>Backspace delay shall last about 0.05 seconds. If OFILL is set, one fill character shall be transmitted.</p>

connection to complete. However, if the O_NONBLOCK flag is set (see <a href="../functions/open.html"><i>open</i>()</a>) or if
CLOCAL has been set, the <a href="../functions/open.html"><i>open</i>()</a> function shall return immediately without waiting for
the connection.</p>

<p>If the object for which the control modes are set is not an asynchronous serial connection, some of the modes may be ignored;
for example, if an attempt is made to set the baud rate on a network connection to a terminal on another host, the baud rate need
not be set on the connection between that terminal and the machine to which it is directly connected.</p>

<p>The initial hardware control value after <a href="../functions/open.html"><i>open</i>()</a> is implementation-defined.</p>

<p>If ECHO is set, input characters shall be echoed back to the terminal. If ECHO is clear, input characters shall not be
echoed.</p>

<p>If ECHOE and ICANON are set, the ERASE character shall cause the terminal to erase, if possible, the last character in the
current line from the display. If there is no character to erase, an implementation may echo an indication that this was the case,
or do nothing.</p>

<p>If ECHOK and ICANON are set, the KILL character shall either cause the terminal to erase the line from the display or shall echo
the &lt;newline&gt; character after the KILL character.</p>

<p>If ECHONL and ICANON are set, the &lt;newline&gt; character shall be echoed even if ECHO is not set.</p>

<p>If ICANON is set, canonical processing shall be enabled. This enables the erase and kill edit functions, and the assembly of
input characters into lines delimited by NL, EOF, and EOL, as described in <a href="#tag_11_01_06">Canonical Mode Input
Processing</a>.<br>
</p>

<p>If ICANON is not set, read requests shall be satisfied directly from the input queue. A read shall not be satisfied until at
least MIN bytes have been received or the timeout value TIME expired between bytes. The time value represents tenths of a second.
See <a href="#tag_11_01_07">Non-Canonical Mode Input Processing</a> for more details.</p>

<p>If IEXTEN is set, implementation-defined functions shall be recognized from the input data. It is implementation-defined how
IEXTEN being set interacts with ICANON, ISIG, IXON, or IXOFF. If IEXTEN is not set, implementation-defined functions shall not be
recognized and the corresponding input characters are processed as described for ICANON, ISIG, IXON, and IXOFF.</p>

<p>If ISIG is set, each input character shall be checked against the special control characters INTR, QUIT, and SUSP. If an input
character matches one of these control characters, the function associated with that character shall be performed. If ISIG is not
set, no checking shall be done. Thus these special input functions are possible only if ISIG is set.</p>

<p>If NOFLSH is set, the normal flush of the input and output queues associated with the INTR, QUIT, and SUSP characters shall not
be done.</p>

<p>If TOSTOP is set, the signal SIGTTOU shall be sent to the process group of a process that tries to write to its controlling
terminal if it is not in the foreground process group for that terminal. This signal, by default, stops the members of the process
group. Otherwise, the output generated by that process shall be output to the current output stream. If the writing process is
ignoring the SIGTTOU signal or the writing thread is blocking the SIGTTOU signal, the process is allowed to produce output, and the
SIGTTOU signal shall not be sent.</p>

<p>The initial local control value after <a href="../functions/open.html"><i>open</i>()</a> is implementation-defined.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_11_02_06">  11.2.6 </a>Special Control Characters</h4>

<p>The subscript values are unique, except that the VMIN and VTIME subscripts may have the same values as the VEOF and VEOL
subscripts, respectively.</p>

<p>Implementations that do not support changing the START and STOP characters may ignore the character values in the <i>c_cc</i>
array indexed by the VSTART and VSTOP subscripts when <a href="../functions/tcsetattr.html"><i>tcsetattr</i>()</a> is called, but
shall return the value in use when <a href="../functions/tcgetattr.html"><i>tcgetattr</i>()</a> is called.</p>

<p>The initial values of all control characters are implementation-defined.</p>

<p>If the value of one of the changeable special control characters (see <a href="#tag_11_01_09">Special Characters</a>) is
_POSIX_VDISABLE, that function shall be disabled; that is, no input data is recognized as the disabled special character. If ICANON
is not set, the value of _POSIX_VDISABLE has no special meaning for the VMIN and VTIME entries of the <i>c_cc</i> array.</p>
