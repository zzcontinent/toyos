<h3><a name="tag_03_271">   3.271 </a>Pathname</h3>

<p>A string that is used to identify a file. In the context of POSIX.1-2017, a pathname may be limited to {PATH_MAX} bytes,

pathname will be usable as a character string in all supported locales; otherwise, the pathname might only be a string (rather than
a character string). Additionally, since the single-byte encoding of the &lt;slash&gt; character is required to be the same across
all locales and to not occur within a multi-byte character, references to a &lt;slash&gt; character within a pathname are
well-defined even when the pathname is not a character string. However, this property does not necessarily hold for the remaining
characters within the portable filename character set.

<h3><a name="tag_03_436">   3.436 </a>User ID</h3>

<p>A non-negative integer that is used to identify a system user. When the identity of a user is associated with a process, a user
