<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_16_286_03"></a>DESCRIPTION</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The <i>kill</i>() function shall send a signal to a process or a group of processes specified by <i>pid</i>. The signal to be
sent is specified by <i>sig</i> and is either one from the list given in <a href=
"../basedefs/signal.h.html"><i>&lt;signal.h&gt;</i></a> or 0. If <i>sig</i> is 0 (the null signal), error checking is performed but
no signal is actually sent. The null signal can be used to check the validity of <i>pid</i>.</p>

<p>For a process to have permission to send a signal to a process designated by <i>pid</i>, unless the sending process has
appropriate privileges, the real or effective user ID of the sending process shall match the real or saved set-user-ID of the
receiving process.</p>

<p>If <i>pid</i> is greater than 0, <i>sig</i> shall be sent to the process whose process ID is equal to <i>pid</i>.</p>

<p>If <i>pid</i> is 0, <i>sig</i> shall be sent to all processes (excluding an unspecified set of system processes) whose process
group ID is equal to the process group ID of the sender, and for which the process has permission to send a signal.</p>

<p>If <i>pid</i> is -1, <i>sig</i> shall be sent to all processes (excluding an unspecified set of system processes) for which the
process has permission to send that signal.</p>

<p>If <i>pid</i> is negative, but not -1, <i>sig</i> shall be sent to all processes (excluding an unspecified set of system
processes) whose process group ID is equal to the absolute value of <i>pid</i>, and for which the process has permission to send a
signal.</p>

<p>If the value of <i>pid</i> causes <i>sig</i> to be generated for the sending process, and if <i>sig</i> is not blocked for the
calling thread and if no other thread has <i>sig</i> unblocked or is waiting in a <a href=
"../functions/sigwait.html"><i>sigwait</i>()</a> function for <i>sig</i>, either <i>sig</i> or at least one pending unblocked
signal shall be delivered to the sending thread before <i>kill</i>() returns.</p>

<p>The user ID tests described above shall not be applied when sending SIGCONT to a process that is a member of the same session as
the sending process.</p>

<p>An implementation that provides extended security controls may impose further implementation-defined restrictions on the sending
of signals, including the null signal. In particular, the system may deny the existence of some or all of the processes specified
by <i>pid</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>kill</i>() function is successful if the process has permission to send <i>sig</i> to any of the processes specified by
<i>pid</i>. If <i>kill</i>() fails, no signal shall be sent.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_16_286_04"></a>RETURN VALUE</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and <i>errno</i> set to indicate the error.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_16_286_05"></a>ERRORS</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The <i>kill</i>() function shall fail if:</p>

<dl compact>
<dt>[EINVAL]</dt>

<dd>The value of the <i>sig</i> argument is an invalid or unsupported signal number.</dd>

<dt>[EPERM]</dt>

<dd>The process does not have permission to send the signal to any receiving process.</dd>

<dt>[ESRCH]</dt>

<dd>No process or process group can be found corresponding to that specified by <i>pid</i>.</dd>

<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_16_286_07"></a>APPLICATION USAGE</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>None.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_16_286_08"></a>RATIONALE</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The semantics for permission checking for <i>kill</i>() differed between System V and most other implementations, such as
Version 7 or 4.3 BSD. The semantics chosen for this volume of POSIX.1-2017 agree with System V. Specifically, a set-user-ID process
cannot protect itself against signals (or at least not against SIGKILL) unless it changes its real user ID. This choice allows the
user who starts an application to send it signals even if it changes its effective user ID. The other semantics give more power to
an application that wants to protect itself from the user who ran it.</p>

<p>Some implementations provide semantic extensions to the <i>kill</i>() function when the absolute value of <i>pid</i> is greater
than some maximum, or otherwise special, value. Negative values are a flag to <i>kill</i>(). Since most implementations return
[ESRCH] in this case, this behavior is not included in this volume of POSIX.1-2017, although a conforming implementation could
provide such an extension.</p>

<p>The unspecified processes to which a signal cannot be sent may include the scheduler or <i>init</i>.</p>

<p>There was initially strong sentiment to specify that, if <i>pid</i> specifies that a signal be sent to the calling process and
that signal is not blocked, that signal would be delivered before <i>kill</i>() returns. This would permit a process to call
<i>kill</i>() and be guaranteed that the call never return. However, historical implementations that provide only the <a href=
"../functions/signal.html"><i>signal</i>()</a> function make only the weaker guarantee in this volume of POSIX.1-2017, because they
only deliver one signal each time a process enters the kernel. Modifications to such implementations to support the <a href=
"../functions/sigaction.html"><i>sigaction</i>()</a> function generally require entry to the kernel following return from a
signal-catching function, in order to restore the signal mask. Such modifications have the effect of satisfying the stronger
requirement, at least when <a href="../functions/sigaction.html"><i>sigaction</i>()</a> is used, but not necessarily when <a href=
"../functions/signal.html"><i>signal</i>()</a> is used. The standard developers considered making the stronger requirement except
when <a href="../functions/signal.html"><i>signal</i>()</a> is used, but felt this would be unnecessarily complex. Implementors are
encouraged to meet the stronger requirement whenever possible. In practice, the weaker requirement is the same, except in the rare
case when two signals arrive during a very short window. This reasoning also applies to a similar requirement for <a href=
"../functions/sigprocmask.html"><i>sigprocmask</i>()</a>.</p>

<p>In 4.2 BSD, the SIGCONT signal can be sent to any descendant process regardless of user-ID security checks. This allows a job
control shell to continue a job even if processes in the job have altered their user IDs (as in the <i>su</i> command). In keeping
with the addition of the concept of sessions, similar functionality is provided by allowing the SIGCONT signal to be sent to any
process in the same session regardless of user ID security checks. This is less restrictive than BSD in the sense that ancestor
processes (in the same session) can now be the recipient. It is more restrictive than BSD in the sense that descendant processes
that form new sessions are now subject to the user ID checks. A similar relaxation of security is not necessary for the other job
control signals since those signals are typically sent by the terminal driver in recognition of special characters being typed; the
terminal driver bypasses all security checks.</p>

<p>In secure implementations, a process may be restricted from sending a signal to a process having a different security label. In
order to prevent the existence or nonexistence of a process from being used as a covert channel, such processes should appear
nonexistent to the sender; that is, [ESRCH] should be returned, rather than [EPERM], if <i>pid</i> refers only to such
processes.</p>

<p>Historical implementations varied on the result of a <i>kill</i>() with <i>pid</i> indicating a zombie process. Some indicated
success on such a call (subject to permission checking), while others gave an error of [ESRCH]. Since the definition of process
lifetime in this volume of POSIX.1-2017 covers zombie processes, the [ESRCH] error as described is inappropriate in this case and
implementations that give this error do not conform. This means that an application cannot have a parent process check for
termination of a particular child by sending it the null signal with <i>kill</i>(), but must instead use <a href=
"../functions/waitpid.html"><i>waitpid</i>()</a> or <a href="../functions/waitid.html"><i>waitid</i>()</a>.</p>

<p>There is some belief that the name <i>kill</i>() is misleading, since the function is not always intended to cause process
termination. However, the name is common to all historical implementations, and any change would be in conflict with the goal of
minimal changes to existing application code.</p>

<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_16_286_11"></a>CHANGE HISTORY</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>First released in Issue 1. Derived from Issue 1 of the SVID.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_16_286_12"></a>Issue 5</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The DESCRIPTION is updated for alignment with the POSIX Threads Extension.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_16_286_13"></a>Issue 6</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>In the SYNOPSIS, the optional include of the <a href="../basedefs/sys_types.h.html"><i>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</i></a> header is
removed.</p>

<p>The following new requirements on POSIX implementations derive from alignment with the Single UNIX Specification:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In the DESCRIPTION, the second paragraph is reworded to indicate that the saved set-user-ID of the calling process is checked in
place of its effective user ID. This is a FIPS requirement.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The requirement to include <a href="../basedefs/sys_types.h.html"><i>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</i></a> has been removed. Although <a
href="../basedefs/sys_types.h.html"><i>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</i></a> was required for conforming implementations of previous POSIX
specifications, it was not required for UNIX applications.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The behavior when <i>pid</i> is -1 is now specified. It was previously explicitly unspecified in the POSIX.1-1988 standard.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The normative text is updated to avoid use of the term &quot;must&quot; for application requirements.</p>

<p>IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001/Cor&nbsp;2-2004, item XSH/TC2/D6/51 is applied, correcting the RATIONALE section.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_16_286_14"></a>Issue 7</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>POSIX.1-2008, Technical Corrigendum 2, XSH/TC2-2008/0194 [765] is applied.</p>
