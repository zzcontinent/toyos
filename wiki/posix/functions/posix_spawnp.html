<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_16_371_03"></a>DESCRIPTION</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>() functions shall create a new process (child process) from the specified
process image. The new process image shall be constructed from a regular executable file called the new process image file.</p>

<p>When a C program is executed as the result of this call, it shall be entered as a C-language function call as follows:</p>

<pre>
<tt>int main(int</tt> <i>argc</i><tt>, char *</tt><i>argv</i><tt>[]);
</tt>
</pre>

<p>where <i>argc</i> is the argument count and <i>argv</i> is an array of character pointers to the arguments themselves. In
addition, the following variable:</p>

<pre>
<tt>extern char **environ;
</tt>
</pre>

<p>shall be initialized as a pointer to an array of character pointers to the environment strings.</p>

<p>The argument <i>argv</i> is an array of character pointers to null-terminated strings. The last member of this array shall be a
null pointer and is not counted in <i>argc</i>. These strings constitute the argument list available to the new process image. The
value in <i>argv</i>[0] should point to a filename string that is associated with the process image being started by the
<i>posix_spawn</i>() or <i>posix_spawnp</i>() function.</p>

<p>The argument <i>envp</i> is an array of character pointers to null-terminated strings. These strings constitute the environment
for the new process image. The environment array is terminated by a null pointer.</p>

<p>The number of bytes available for the combined argument and environment lists of the child process is {ARG_MAX}. The
implementation shall specify in the system documentation (see XBD <a href=
"../basedefs/V1_chap02.html#tag_02"><i>Conformance</i></a>) whether any list overhead, such as length words, null terminators,
pointers, or alignment bytes, is included in this total.</p>

<p>The <i>path</i> argument to <i>posix_spawn</i>() is a pathname that identifies the new process image file to execute.</p>

<p>The <i>file</i> parameter to <i>posix_spawnp</i>() shall be used to construct a pathname that identifies the new process image
file. If the <i>file</i> parameter contains a &lt;slash&gt; character, the <i>file</i> parameter shall be used as the pathname for
the new process image file. Otherwise, the path prefix for this file shall be obtained by a search of the directories passed as the
environment variable <i>PATH</i> (see XBD <a href="../basedefs/V1_chap08.html#tag_08"><i>Environment Variables</i></a>). If this
environment variable is not defined, the results of the search are implementation-defined.</p>

<p>If <i>file_actions</i> is a null pointer, then file descriptors open in the calling process shall remain open in the child
process, except for those whose close-on- <i><a href="../functions/exec.html">exec</a></i> flag FD_CLOEXEC is set (see <a href=
"../functions/fcntl.html#"><i>fcntl</i></a>). For those file descriptors that remain open, the child process shall not inherit any
file locks, but all remaining attributes of the corresponding open file descriptions (see <a href=
"../functions/fcntl.html#"><i>fcntl</i></a>), shall remain unchanged.</p>

<p>If <i>file_actions</i> is not NULL, then the file descriptors open in the child process shall be those open in the calling
process as modified by the spawn file actions object pointed to by <i>file_actions</i> and the FD_CLOEXEC flag of each remaining
open file descriptor after the spawn file actions have been processed. The effective order of processing the spawn file actions
shall be:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The set of open file descriptors for the child process shall initially be the same set as is open for the calling process. The
child process shall not inherit any file locks, but all remaining attributes of the corresponding open file descriptions (see <a
href="../functions/fcntl.html#"><i>fcntl</i></a>), shall remain unchanged.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The signal mask, signal default actions, and the effective user and group IDs for the child process shall be changed as
specified in the attributes object referenced by <i>attrp</i>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The file actions specified by the spawn file actions object shall be performed in the order in which they were added to the
spawn file actions object.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Any file descriptor that has its FD_CLOEXEC flag set (see <a href="../functions/fcntl.html#"><i>fcntl</i></a>) shall be
closed.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>If file descriptor 0, 1, or 2 would otherwise be closed in the new process image created by <i>posix_spawn</i>() or
<i>posix_spawnp</i>(), implementations may open an unspecified file for the file descriptor in the new process image. If a standard
utility or a conforming application is executed with file descriptor 0 not open for reading or with file descriptor 1 or 2 not open
for writing, the environment in which the utility or application is executed shall be deemed non-conforming, and consequently the
utility or application might not behave as described in this standard.</p>

<p>The <b>posix_spawnattr_t</b> spawn attributes object type is defined in <a href=
"../basedefs/spawn.h.html"><i>&lt;spawn.h&gt;</i></a>. It shall contain at least the attributes defined below.</p>

<p>If the POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP flag is set in the <i>spawn-flags</i> attribute of the object referenced by <i>attrp</i>, and the
<i>spawn-pgroup</i> attribute of the same object is non-zero, then the child's process group shall be as specified in the
<i>spawn-pgroup</i> attribute of the object referenced by <i>attrp</i>.</p>

<p>As a special case, if the POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP flag is set in the <i>spawn-flags</i> attribute of the object referenced by
<i>attrp</i>, and the <i>spawn-pgroup</i> attribute of the same object is set to zero, then the child shall be in a new process
group with a process group ID equal to its process ID.</p>

<p>If the POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP flag is not set in the <i>spawn-flags</i> attribute of the object referenced by <i>attrp</i>, the
new child process shall inherit the parent's process group.</p>

<p><sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('PS')">PS</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0"> If
the POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDPARAM flag is set in the <i>spawn-flags</i> attribute of the object referenced by <i>attrp</i>, but
POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER is not set, the new process image shall initially have the scheduling policy of the calling process with
the scheduling parameters specified in the <i>spawn-schedparam</i> attribute of the object referenced by <i>attrp</i>.</p>

<p>If the POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER flag is set in the <i>spawn-flags</i> attribute of the object referenced by <i>attrp</i>
(regardless of the setting of the POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDPARAM flag), the new process image shall initially have the scheduling policy
specified in the <i>spawn-schedpolicy</i> attribute of the object referenced by <i>attrp</i> and the scheduling parameters
specified in the <i>spawn-schedparam</i> attribute of the same object. <img src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border=
"0"></p>

<p>The POSIX_SPAWN_RESETIDS flag in the <i>spawn-flags</i> attribute of the object referenced by <i>attrp</i> governs the effective
user ID of the child process. If this flag is not set, the child process shall inherit the effective user ID of the parent process.
If this flag is set, the effective user ID of the child process shall be reset to the parent's real user ID. In either case, if the
set-user-ID mode bit of the new process image file is set, the effective user ID of the child process shall become that file's
owner ID before the new process image begins execution.</p>

<p>The POSIX_SPAWN_RESETIDS flag in the <i>spawn-flags</i> attribute of the object referenced by <i>attrp</i> also governs the
effective group ID of the child process. If this flag is not set, the child process shall inherit the effective group ID of the
parent process. If this flag is set, the effective group ID of the child process shall be reset to the parent's real group ID. In
either case, if the set-group-ID mode bit of the new process image file is set, the effective group ID of the child process shall
become that file's group ID before the new process image begins execution.</p>

<p>If the POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGMASK flag is set in the <i>spawn-flags</i> attribute of the object referenced by <i>attrp</i>, the
child process shall initially have the signal mask specified in the <i>spawn-sigmask</i> attribute of the object referenced by
<i>attrp</i>.</p>

<p>If the POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGDEF flag is set in the <i>spawn-flags</i> attribute of the object referenced by <i>attrp</i>, the
signals specified in the <i>spawn-sigdefault</i> attribute of the same object shall be set to their default actions in the child
process. Signals set to the default action in the parent process shall be set to the default action in the child process.</p>

<p>Signals set to be caught by the calling process shall be set to the default action in the child process.</p>

<p>Except for SIGCHLD, signals set to be ignored by the calling process image shall be set to be ignored by the child process,
unless otherwise specified by the POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGDEF flag being set in the <i>spawn-flags</i> attribute of the object referenced
by <i>attrp</i> and the signals being indicated in the <i>spawn-sigdefault</i> attribute of the object referenced by
<i>attrp</i>.</p>

<p>If the SIGCHLD signal is set to be ignored by the calling process, it is unspecified whether the SIGCHLD signal is set to be
ignored or to the default action in the child process, unless otherwise specified by the POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGDEF flag being set in
the <i>spawn_flags</i> attribute of the object referenced by <i>attrp</i> and the SIGCHLD signal being indicated in the
<i>spawn_sigdefault</i> attribute of the object referenced by <i>attrp</i>.</p>

<p>If the value of the <i>attrp</i> pointer is NULL, then the default values are used.</p>

<p>All process attributes, other than those influenced by the attributes set in the object referenced by <i>attrp</i> as specified
above or by the file descriptor manipulations specified in <i>file_actions</i>, shall appear in the new process image as though <a
href="../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a> had been called to create a child process and then a member of the <i><a href=
"../functions/exec.html">exec</a></i> family of functions had been called by the child process to execute the new process
image.</p>

<p>It is implementation-defined whether the fork handlers are run when <i>posix_spawn</i>() or <i>posix_spawnp</i>() is called.</p>

value. Otherwise, no child process shall be created, the value stored into the variable pointed to by a non-NULL <i>pid</i> is

</blockquote>

<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_16_371_08"></a>RATIONALE</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The <i>posix_spawn</i>() function and its close relation <i>posix_spawnp</i>() have been introduced to overcome the following
perceived difficulties with <a href="../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a>: the <a href=
"../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a> function is difficult or impossible to implement without swapping or dynamic address
translation.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Swapping is generally too slow for a realtime environment.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Dynamic address translation is not available everywhere that POSIX might be useful.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Processes are too useful to simply option out of POSIX whenever it must run without address translation or other MMU
services.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, POSIX needs process creation and file execution primitives that can be efficiently implemented without address translation
or other MMU services.</p>

<p>The <i>posix_spawn</i>() function is implementable as a library routine, but both <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>()
are designed as kernel operations. Also, although they may be an efficient replacement for many <a href=
"../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a>/ <i><a href="../functions/exec.html">exec</a></i> pairs, their goal is to provide useful
process creation primitives for systems that have difficulty with <a href="../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a>, not to
provide drop-in replacements for <a href="../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a>/ <i><a href=
"../functions/exec.html">exec</a></i>.</p>

<p>This view of the role of <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>() influenced the design of their API. It does not attempt
to provide the full functionality of <a href="../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a>/ <i><a href=
"../functions/exec.html">exec</a></i> in which arbitrary user-specified operations of any sort are permitted between the creation
of the child process and the execution of the new process image; any attempt to reach that level would need to provide a
programming language as parameters. Instead, <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>() are process creation primitives like
the <i>Start_Process</i> and <i>Start_Process_Search</i> Ada language bindings package <i>POSIX_Process_Primitives</i> and also
like those in many operating systems that are not UNIX systems, but with some POSIX-specific additions.</p>

<p>To achieve its coverage goals, <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>() have control of six types of inheritance: file
descriptors, process group ID, user and group ID, signal mask, scheduling, and whether each signal ignored in the parent will
remain ignored in the child, or be reset to its default action in the child.</p>

<p>Control of file descriptors is required to allow an independently written child process image to access data streams opened by
and even generated or read by the parent process without being specifically coded to know which parent files and file descriptors
are to be used. Control of the process group ID is required to control how the job control of the child process relates to that of
the parent.</p>

<p>Control of the signal mask and signal defaulting is sufficient to support the implementation of <a href=
"../functions/system.html"><i>system</i>()</a>. Although support for <a href="../functions/system.html"><i>system</i>()</a> is not
explicitly one of the goals for <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>(), it is covered under the &quot;at least 50%&quot; coverage
goal.</p>

<p>The intention is that the normal file descriptor inheritance across <a href="../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a>, the
subsequent effect of the specified spawn file actions, and the normal file descriptor inheritance across one of the <i><a href=
"../functions/exec.html">exec</a></i> family of functions should fully specify open file inheritance. The implementation need make
no decisions regarding the set of open file descriptors when the child process image begins execution, those decisions having
already been made by the caller and expressed as the set of open file descriptors and their FD_CLOEXEC flags at the time of the
call and the spawn file actions object specified in the call. We have been assured that in cases where the POSIX
<i>Start_Process</i> Ada primitives have been implemented in a library, this method of controlling file descriptor inheritance may
be implemented very easily.</p>

<p>We can identify several problems with <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>(), but there does not appear to be a solution
that introduces fewer problems. Environment modification for child process attributes not specifiable via the <i>attrp</i> or
<i>file_actions</i> arguments must be done in the parent process, and since the parent generally wants to save its context, it is
more costly than similar functionality with <a href="../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a>/ <i><a href=
"../functions/exec.html">exec</a></i>. It is also complicated to modify the environment of a multi-threaded process temporarily,
since all threads must agree when it is safe for the environment to be changed. However, this cost is only borne by those
invocations of <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>() that use the additional functionality. Since extensive modifications
are not the usual case, and are particularly unlikely in time-critical code, keeping much of the environment control out of
<i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>() is appropriate design.</p>

<p>The <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>() functions do not have all the power of <a href=
"../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a>/ <i><a href="../functions/exec.html">exec</a></i>. This is to be expected. The <a href=
"../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a> function is a wonderfully powerful operation. We do not expect to duplicate its
functionality in a simple, fast function with no special hardware requirements. It is worth noting that <i>posix_spawn</i>() and
<i>posix_spawnp</i>() are very similar to the process creation operations on many operating systems that are not UNIX systems.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_16_371_08_01"></a>Requirements</h5>

<p>The requirements for <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>() are:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>They must be implementable without an MMU or unusual hardware.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>They must be compatible with existing POSIX standards.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional goals are:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>They should be efficiently implementable.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>They should be able to replace at least 50% of typical executions of <a href="../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A system with <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>() and without <a href="../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a>
should be useful, at least for realtime applications.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A system with <a href="../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a> and the <i><a href="../functions/exec.html">exec</a></i> family
should be able to implement <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>() as library routines.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h5><a name="tag_16_371_08_02"></a>Two-Syntax</h5>

<p>POSIX <i><a href="../functions/exec.html">exec</a></i> has several calling sequences with approximately the same functionality.
These appear to be required for compatibility with existing practice. Since the existing practice for the <i>posix_spawn*</i>()
functions is otherwise substantially unlike POSIX, we feel that simplicity outweighs compatibility. There are, therefore, only two
names for the <i>posix_spawn*</i>() functions.</p>

<p>The parameter list does not differ between <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>(); <i>posix_spawnp</i>() interprets the
second parameter more elaborately than <i>posix_spawn</i>().</p>

<h5><a name="tag_16_371_08_03"></a>Compatibility with POSIX.5 (Ada)</h5>

<p>The <i>Start_Process</i> and <i>Start_Process_Search</i> procedures from the <i>POSIX_Process_Primitives</i> package from the
Ada language binding to POSIX.1 encapsulate <a href="../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a> and <i><a href=
"../functions/exec.html">exec</a></i> functionality in a manner similar to that of <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>().
Originally, in keeping with our simplicity goal, the standard developers had limited the capabilities of <i>posix_spawn</i>() and
<i>posix_spawnp</i>() to a subset of the capabilities of <i>Start_Process</i> and <i>Start_Process_Search</i>; certain non-default
capabilities were not supported. However, based on suggestions by the ballot group to improve file descriptor mapping or drop it,
and on the advice of an Ada Language Bindings working group member, the standard developers decided that <i>posix_spawn</i>() and
<i>posix_spawnp</i>() should be sufficiently powerful to implement <i>Start_Process</i> and <i>Start_Process_Search</i>. The
rationale is that if the Ada language binding to such a primitive had already been approved as an IEEE standard, there can be
little justification for not approving the functionally-equivalent parts of a C binding. The only three capabilities provided by
<i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>() that are not provided by <i>Start_Process</i> and <i>Start_Process_Search</i> are
optionally specifying the child's process group ID, the set of signals to be reset to default signal handling in the child process,
and the child's scheduling policy and parameters.</p>

<p>For the Ada language binding for <i>Start_Process</i> to be implemented with <i>posix_spawn</i>(), that binding would need to
explicitly pass an empty signal mask and the parent's environment to <i>posix_spawn</i>() whenever the caller of
<i>Start_Process</i> allowed these arguments to default, since <i>posix_spawn</i>() does not provide such defaults. The ability of
<i>Start_Process</i> to mask user-specified signals during its execution is functionally unique to the Ada language binding and
must be dealt with in the binding separately from the call to <i>posix_spawn</i>().</p>

<h5><a name="tag_16_371_08_04"></a>Process Group</h5>

<p>The process group inheritance field can be used to join the child process with an existing process group. By assigning a value
of zero to the <i>spawn-pgroup</i> attribute of the object referenced by <i>attrp</i>, the <a href=
"../functions/setpgid.html"><i>setpgid</i>()</a> mechanism will place the child process in a new process group.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_16_371_08_05"></a>Threads</h5>

<p>Without the <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>() functions, systems without address translation can still use threads
to give an abstraction of concurrency. In many cases, thread creation suffices, but it is not always a good substitute. The
<i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>() functions are considerably &quot;heavier&quot; than thread creation. Processes have several
important attributes that threads do not. Even without address translation, a process may have base-and-bound memory protection.
Each process has a process environment including security attributes and file capabilities, and powerful scheduling attributes.
Processes abstract the behavior of non-uniform-memory-architecture multi-processors better than threads, and they are more
convenient to use for activities that are not closely linked.</p>

<p>The <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>() functions may not bring support for multiple processes to every
configuration. Process creation is not the only piece of operating system support required to support multiple processes. The total
cost of support for multiple processes may be quite high in some circumstances. Existing practice shows that support for multiple
processes is uncommon and threads are common among &quot;tiny kernels&quot;. There should, therefore, probably continue to be AEPs for
operating systems with only one process.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_16_371_08_06"></a>Asynchronous Error Notification</h5>

<p>A library implementation of <i>posix_spawn</i>() or <i>posix_spawnp</i>() may not be able to detect all possible errors before
it forks the child process. POSIX.1-2017 provides for an error indication returned from a child process which could not
successfully complete the spawn operation via a special exit status which may be detected using the status value returned by <a
href="../functions/wait.html"><i>wait</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/waitid.html"><i>waitid</i>()</a>, and <a href=
"../functions/waitpid.html"><i>waitpid</i>()</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>stat_val</i> interface and the macros used to interpret it are not well suited to the purpose of returning API errors,
but they are the only path available to a library implementation. Thus, an implementation may cause the child process to exit with
exit status 127 for any error detected during the spawn process after the <i>posix_spawn</i>() or <i>posix_spawnp</i>() function
has successfully returned.</p>

<p>The standard developers had proposed using two additional macros to interpret <i>stat_val</i>. The first, WIFSPAWNFAIL, would
have detected a status that indicated that the child exited because of an error detected during the <i>posix_spawn</i>() or
<i>posix_spawnp</i>() operations rather than during actual execution of the child process image; the second, WSPAWNERRNO, would
have extracted the error value if WIFSPAWNFAIL indicated a failure. Unfortunately, the ballot group strongly opposed this because
it would make a library implementation of <i>posix_spawn</i>() or <i>posix_spawnp</i>() dependent on kernel modifications to <a
href="../functions/waitpid.html"><i>waitpid</i>()</a> to be able to embed special information in <i>stat_val</i> to indicate a
spawn failure.</p>

<p>The 8 bits of child process exit status that are guaranteed by POSIX.1-2017 to be accessible to the waiting parent process are
insufficient to disambiguate a spawn error from any other kind of error that may be returned by an arbitrary process image. No
other bits of the exit status are required to be visible in <i>stat_val</i>, so these macros could not be strictly implemented at
the library level. Reserving an exit status of 127 for such spawn errors is consistent with the use of this value by <a href=
"../functions/system.html"><i>system</i>()</a> and <a href="../functions/popen.html"><i>popen</i>()</a> to signal failures in these
operations that occur after the function has returned but before a shell is able to execute. The exit status of 127 does not
uniquely identify this class of error, nor does it provide any detailed information on the nature of the failure. Note that a
kernel implementation of <i>posix_spawn</i>() or <i>posix_spawnp</i>() is permitted (and encouraged) to return any possible error
as the function value, thus providing more detailed failure information to the parent process.</p>

<p>Thus, no special macros are available to isolate asynchronous <i>posix_spawn</i>() or <i>posix_spawnp</i>() errors. Instead,
errors detected by the <i>posix_spawn</i>() or <i>posix_spawnp</i>() operations in the context of the child process before the new
process image executes are reported by setting the child's exit status to 127. The calling process may use the WIFEXITED and
WEXITSTATUS macros on the <i>stat_val</i> stored by the <a href="../functions/wait.html"><i>wait</i>()</a> or <a href=
"../functions/waitpid.html"><i>waitpid</i>()</a> functions to detect spawn failures to the extent that other status values with
which the child process image may exit (before the parent can conclusively determine that the child process image has begun
execution) are distinct from exit status 127.</p>
