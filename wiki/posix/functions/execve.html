<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_16_111_03"></a>DESCRIPTION</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The <i>exec</i> family of functions shall replace the current process image with a new process image. The new image shall be
constructed from a regular, executable file called the <i>new process image file</i>. There shall be no return from a successful
<i>exec</i>, because the calling process image is overlaid by the new process image.</p>

<p>The <i>fexecve</i>() function shall be equivalent to the <i>execve</i>() function except that the file to be executed is
determined by the file descriptor <i>fd</i> instead of a pathname. The file offset of <i>fd</i> is ignored.</p>

<p>When a C-language program is executed as a result of a call to one of the <i>exec</i> family of functions, it shall be entered
as a C-language function call as follows:</p>

<pre>
<tt>int main (</tt><i>int argc, char *argv</i><tt>[]);
</tt>
</pre>

<p>where <i>argc</i> is the argument count and <i>argv</i> is an array of character pointers to the arguments themselves. In
addition, the following variable, which must be declared by the user if it is to be used directly:</p>

<pre>
<tt>extern char **environ;
</tt>
</pre>

<p>is initialized as a pointer to an array of character pointers to the environment strings. The <i>argv</i> and <i>environ</i>
arrays are each terminated by a null pointer. The null pointer terminating the <i>argv</i> array is not counted in <i>argc</i>.</p>

<p>Applications can change the entire environment in a single operation by assigning the <i>environ</i> variable to point to an
array of character pointers to the new environment strings. After assigning a new value to <i>environ</i>, applications should not
rely on the new environment strings remaining part of the environment, as a call to <a href=
"../functions/getenv.html"><i>getenv</i>()</a>, <sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('XSI')">XSI</a>]</sup> <img src=
"../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0"> <a href="../functions/putenv.html"><i>putenv</i>()</a>, <img src=
"../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border="0"> <a href="../functions/setenv.html"><i>setenv</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/unsetenv.html"><i>unsetenv</i>()</a>, or any function that is dependent on an environment variable may, on noticing
that <i>environ</i> has changed, copy the environment strings to a new array and assign <i>environ</i> to point to it.</p>

<p>Any application that directly modifies the pointers to which the <i>environ</i> variable points has undefined behavior.</p>

<p>Conforming multi-threaded applications shall not use the <i>environ</i> variable to access or modify any environment variable
while any other thread is concurrently modifying any environment variable. A call to any function dependent on any environment
variable shall be considered a use of the <i>environ</i> variable to access that environment variable.</p>

<p>The arguments specified by a program with one of the <i>exec</i> functions shall be passed on to the new process image in the
corresponding <i>main</i>() arguments.</p>

<p>The argument <i>path</i> points to a pathname that identifies the new process image file.</p>

<p>The argument <i>file</i> is used to construct a pathname that identifies the new process image file. If the <i>file</i> argument
contains a &lt;slash&gt; character, the <i>file</i> argument shall be used as the pathname for this file. Otherwise, the path
prefix for this file is obtained by a search of the directories passed as the environment variable <i>PATH</i> (see XBD <a href=
"../basedefs/V1_chap08.html#tag_08"><i>Environment Variables</i></a>). If this environment variable is not present, the results of
the search are implementation-defined.</p>

<p>There are two distinct ways in which the contents of the process image file may cause the execution to fail, distinguished by
the setting of <i>errno</i> to either [ENOEXEC] or [EINVAL] (see the ERRORS section). In the cases where the other members of the
<i>exec</i> family of functions would fail and set <i>errno</i> to [ENOEXEC], the <i>execlp</i>() and <i>execvp</i>() functions
shall execute a command interpreter and the environment of the executed command shall be as if the process invoked the <a href=
"../utilities/sh.html"><i>sh</i></a> utility using <i>execl</i>() as follows:</p>

<pre>
<tt>execl(&lt;shell path&gt;, arg0, file, arg1, ..., (char *)0);
</tt>
</pre>

<p>where &lt;<i>shell&nbsp;path</i>&gt; is an unspecified pathname for the <a href="../utilities/sh.html"><i>sh</i></a> utility,
<i>file</i> is the process image file, and for <i>execvp</i>(), where <i>arg</i>0, <i>arg</i>1, and so on correspond to the values
passed to <i>execvp</i>() in <i>argv</i>[0], <i>argv</i>[1], and so on.</p>

<p>The arguments represented by <i>arg0</i>,... are pointers to null-terminated character strings. These strings shall constitute
the argument list available to the new process image. The list is terminated by a null pointer. The argument <i>arg0</i> should
point to a filename string that is associated with the process being started by one of the <i>exec</i> functions.</p>

<p>The argument <i>argv</i> is an array of character pointers to null-terminated strings. The application shall ensure that the
last member of this array is a null pointer. These strings shall constitute the argument list available to the new process image.
The value in <i>argv</i>[0] should point to a filename string that is associated with the process being started by one of the
<i>exec</i> functions.</p>

<p>The argument <i>envp</i> is an array of character pointers to null-terminated strings. These strings shall constitute the
environment for the new process image. The <i>envp</i> array is terminated by a null pointer.</p>

<p>For those forms not containing an <i>envp</i> pointer (<i>execl</i>(), <i>execv</i>(), <i>execlp</i>(), and <i>execvp</i>()),
the environment for the new process image shall be taken from the external variable <i>environ</i> in the calling process.</p>

<p>The number of bytes available for the new process' combined argument and environment lists is {ARG_MAX}. It is
implementation-defined whether null terminators, pointers, and/or any alignment bytes are included in this total.</p>

<p>File descriptors open in the calling process image shall remain open in the new process image, except for those whose close-on-
<i>exec</i> flag FD_CLOEXEC is set. For those file descriptors that remain open, all attributes of the open file description remain
unchanged. For any file descriptor that is closed for this reason, file locks are removed as a result of the close as described in
<a href="../functions/close.html"><i>close</i>()</a>. Locks that are not removed by closing of file descriptors remain
unchanged.</p>

<p>If file descriptor 0, 1, or 2 would otherwise be closed after a successful call to one of the <i>exec</i> family of functions,
implementations may open an unspecified file for the file descriptor in the new process image. If a standard utility or a
conforming application is executed with file descriptor 0 not open for reading or with file descriptor 1 or 2 not open for writing,
the environment in which the utility or application is executed shall be deemed non-conforming, and consequently the utility or
application might not behave as described in this standard.</p>

<p>Directory streams open in the calling process image shall be closed in the new process image.</p>

<p>The state of the floating-point environment in the initial thread of the new process image shall be set to the default.</p>

<p>The state of conversion descriptors and message catalog descriptors in the new process image is undefined.</p>

<p>For the new process image, the equivalent of:</p>

<pre>
<tt>setlocale(LC_ALL, "C")
</tt>
</pre>

<p>shall be executed at start-up.</p>

<p>Signals set to the default action (SIG_DFL) in the calling process image shall be set to the default action in the new process
image. Except for SIGCHLD, signals set to be ignored (SIG_IGN) by the calling process image shall be set to be ignored by the new
process image. Signals set to be caught by the calling process image shall be set to the default action in the new process image
(see <a href="../basedefs/signal.h.html"><i>&lt;signal.h&gt;</i></a>).</p>

<p>If the SIGCHLD signal is set to be ignored by the calling process image, it is unspecified whether the SIGCHLD signal is set to
be ignored or to the default action in the new process image.</p>

&nbsp;After a successful call to any of the <i>exec</i> functions, alternate signal stacks are not preserved and the SA_ONSTACK

<p>After a successful call to any of the <i>exec</i> functions, any functions previously registered by the <a href=

real user ID, real group ID, and supplementary group IDs of the new process image shall remain the same as those of the calling
process image. The effective user ID and effective group ID of the new process image shall be saved (as the saved set-user-ID and
the saved set-group-ID) for use by <a href="../functions/setuid.html"><i>setuid</i>()</a>.</p>

<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_16_111_07"></a>APPLICATION USAGE</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>As the state of conversion descriptors and message catalog descriptors in the new process image is undefined, conforming
applications should not rely on their use and should close them prior to calling one of the <i>exec</i> functions.</p>

<p>Applications that require other than the default POSIX locale as the global locale in the new process image should call <a href=
"../functions/setlocale.html"><i>setlocale</i>()</a> with the appropriate parameters.</p>

<p>When assigning a new value to the <i>environ</i> variable, applications should ensure that the environment to which it will
point contains at least the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Any implementation-defined variables required by the implementation to provide a conforming environment. See the _CS_V7_ENV
entry in <a href="../basedefs/unistd.h.html"><i>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</i></a> and <a href=
"../functions/confstr.html"><i>confstr</i>()</a> for details.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A value for <i>PATH</i> which finds conforming versions of all standard utilities before any other versions.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The same constraint applies to the <i>envp</i> array passed to <i>execle</i>() or <i>execve</i>(), in order to ensure that the
new process image is invoked in a conforming environment.</p>

<p>Applications should not execute programs with file descriptor 0 not open for reading or with file descriptor 1 or 2 not open for
writing, as this might cause the executed program to misbehave. In order not to pass on these file descriptors to an executed
program, applications should not just close them but should reopen them on, for example, <b>/dev/null</b>. Some implementations may
reopen them automatically, but applications should not rely on this being done.</p>

<p>If an application wants to perform a checksum test of the file being executed before executing it, the file will need to be
opened with read permission to perform the checksum test.</p>

<p>Since execute permission is checked by <i>fexecve</i>(), the file description <i>fd</i> need not have been opened with the
O_EXEC flag. However, if the file to be executed denies read and write permission for the process preparing to do the <i>exec</i>,
the only way to provide the <i>fd</i> to <i>fexecve</i>() will be to use the O_EXEC flag when opening <i>fd</i>. In this case, the
application will not be able to perform a checksum test since it will not be able to read the contents of the file.</p>

<p>Note that when a file descriptor is opened with O_RDONLY, O_RDWR, or O_WRONLY mode, the file descriptor can be used to read,
read and write, or write the file, respectively, even if the mode of the file changes after the file was opened. Using the O_EXEC
open mode is different; <i>fexecve</i>() will ignore the mode that was used when the file descriptor was opened and the <i>exec</i>
will fail if the mode of the file associated with <i>fd</i> does not grant execute permission to the calling process at the time
<i>fexecve</i>() is called.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_16_111_08"></a>RATIONALE</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Early proposals required that the value of <i>argc</i> passed to <i>main</i>() be &quot;one or greater&quot;. This was driven by the
same requirement in drafts of the ISO&nbsp;C standard. In fact, historical implementations have passed a value of zero when no
arguments are supplied to the caller of the <i>exec</i> functions. This requirement was removed from the ISO&nbsp;C standard and
subsequently removed from this volume of POSIX.1-2017 as well. The wording, in particular the use of the word <i>should</i>,
requires a Strictly Conforming POSIX Application to pass at least one argument to the <i>exec</i> function, thus guaranteeing that
<i>argc</i> be one or greater when invoked by such an application. In fact, this is good practice, since many existing applications
reference <i>argv</i>[0] without first checking the value of <i>argc</i>.</p>

<p>The requirement on a Strictly Conforming POSIX Application also states that the value passed as the first argument be a filename
string associated with the process being started. Although some existing applications pass a pathname rather than a filename string
in some circumstances, a filename string is more generally useful, since the common usage of <i>argv</i>[0] is in printing
diagnostics. In some cases the filename passed is not the actual filename of the file; for example, many implementations of the
<i>login</i> utility use a convention of prefixing a &lt;hyphen-minus&gt; ( <tt>'-'</tt> ) to the actual filename, which indicates
to the command interpreter being invoked that it is a &quot;login shell&quot;.</p>

<p>Also, note that the <a href="../utilities/test.html"><i>test</i></a> and <i>[</i> utilities require specific strings for the
<i>argv</i>[0] argument to have deterministic behavior across all implementations.</p>

<p>Historically, there have been two ways that implementations can <i>exec</i> shell scripts.</p>

<p>One common historical implementation is that the <i>execl</i>(), <i>execv</i>(), <i>execle</i>(), and <i>execve</i>() functions
return an [ENOEXEC] error for any file not recognizable as executable, including a shell script. When the <i>execlp</i>() and
<i>execvp</i>() functions encounter such a file, they assume the file to be a shell script and invoke a known command interpreter
to interpret such files. This is now required by POSIX.1-2017. These implementations of <i>execvp</i>() and <i>execlp</i>() only
give the [ENOEXEC] error in the rare case of a problem with the command interpreter's executable file. Because of these
implementations, the [ENOEXEC] error is not mentioned for <i>execlp</i>() or <i>execvp</i>(), although implementations can still
give it.</p>

<p>Another way that some historical implementations handle shell scripts is by recognizing the first two bytes of the file as the
character string <tt>"#!"</tt> and using the remainder of the first line of the file as the name of the command interpreter to
execute.</p>

<p>One potential source of confusion noted by the standard developers is over how the contents of a process image file affect the
behavior of the <i>exec</i> family of functions. The following is a description of the actions taken:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>If the process image file is a valid executable (in a format that is executable and valid and having appropriate privileges) for
this system, then the system executes the file.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If the process image file has appropriate privileges and is in a format that is executable but not valid for this system (such
as a recognized binary for another architecture), then this is an error and <i>errno</i> is set to [EINVAL] (see later RATIONALE on
[EINVAL]).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If the process image file has appropriate privileges but is not otherwise recognized:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If this is a call to <i>execlp</i>() or <i>execvp</i>(), then they invoke a command interpreter assuming that the process image
file is a shell script.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If this is not a call to <i>execlp</i>() or <i>execvp</i>(), then an error occurs and <i>errno</i> is set to [ENOEXEC].</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Applications that do not require to access their arguments may use the form:</p>

<pre>
<tt>main(void)
</tt>
</pre>

as specified in the ISO&nbsp;C standard. However, the implementation will always provide the two arguments <i>argc</i> and
<i>argv</i>, even if they are not used. 

<p>Some implementations provide a third argument to <i>main</i>() called <i>envp</i>. This is defined as a pointer to the
environment. The ISO&nbsp;C standard specifies invoking <i>main</i>() with two arguments, so implementations must support
applications written this way. Since this volume of POSIX.1-2017 defines the global variable <i>environ</i>, which is also provided
by historical implementations and can be used anywhere that <i>envp</i> could be used, there is no functional need for the
<i>envp</i> argument. Applications should use the <a href="../functions/getenv.html"><i>getenv</i>()</a> function rather than
accessing the environment directly via either <i>envp</i> or <i>environ</i>. Implementations are required to support the
two-argument calling sequence, but this does not prohibit an implementation from supporting <i>envp</i> as an optional third
argument.</p>

<p>This volume of POSIX.1-2017 specifies that signals set to SIG_IGN remain set to SIG_IGN, and that the new process image inherits
the signal mask of the thread that called <i>exec</i> in the old process image. This is consistent with historical implementations,
and it permits some useful functionality, such as the <a href="../utilities/nohup.html"><i>nohup</i></a> command. However, it
should be noted that many existing applications wrongly assume that they start with certain signals set to the default action
and/or unblocked. In particular, applications written with a simpler signal model that does not include blocking of signals, such
as the one in the ISO&nbsp;C standard, may not behave properly if invoked with some signals blocked. Therefore, it is best not to
block or ignore signals across <i>exec</i>s without explicit reason to do so, and especially not to block signals across
<i>exec</i>s of arbitrary (not closely cooperating) programs.</p>

<p>The <i>exec</i> functions always save the value of the effective user ID and effective group ID of the process at the completion
of the <i>exec</i>, whether or not the set-user-ID or the set-group-ID bit of the process image file is set.</p>

<p>The statement about <i>argv</i>[] and <i>envp</i>[] being constants is included to make explicit to future writers of language
bindings that these objects are completely constant. Due to a limitation of the ISO&nbsp;C standard, it is not possible to state
that idea in standard C. Specifying two levels of <i>const</i>- <i>qualification</i> for the <i>argv</i>[] and <i>envp</i>[]
parameters for the <i>exec</i> functions may seem to be the natural choice, given that these functions do not modify either the
array of pointers or the characters to which the function points, but this would disallow existing correct code. Instead, only the
array of pointers is noted as constant. The table of assignment compatibility for <i>dst</i>= <i>src</i> derived from the
ISO&nbsp;C standard summarizes the compatibility:</p>

<p>Since all existing code has a source type matching the first row, the column that gives the most valid combinations is the third
column. The only other possibility is the fourth column, but using it would require a cast on the <i>argv</i> or <i>envp</i>
arguments. It is unfortunate that the fourth column cannot be used, because the declaration a non-expert would naturally use would
be that in the second row.</p>

<p>The ISO&nbsp;C standard and this volume of POSIX.1-2017 do not conflict on the use of <i>environ</i>, but some historical
implementations of <i>environ</i> may cause a conflict. As long as <i>environ</i> is treated in the same way as an entry point (for
example, <a href="../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a>), it conforms to both standards. A library can contain <a href=
"../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a>, but if there is a user-provided <a href="../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a>,
that <a href="../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a> is given precedence and no problem ensues. The situation is similar for
<i>environ</i>: the definition in this volume of POSIX.1-2017 is to be used if there is no user-provided <i>environ</i> to take
precedence. At least three implementations are known to exist that solve this problem.</p>

<dl compact>
<dt>[E2BIG]</dt>

<dd>The limit {ARG_MAX} applies not just to the size of the argument list, but to the sum of that and the size of the environment
list.</dd>

<dt>[EFAULT]</dt>

<dd>Some historical systems return [EFAULT] rather than [ENOEXEC] when the new process image file is corrupted. They are
non-conforming.</dd>

<dt>[EINVAL]</dt>

<dd>This error condition was added to POSIX.1-2017 to allow an implementation to detect executable files generated for different
architectures, and indicate this situation to the application. Historical implementations of shells, <i>execvp</i>(), and
<i>execlp</i>() that encounter an [ENOEXEC] error will execute a shell on the assumption that the file is a shell script. This will
not produce the desired effect when the file is a valid executable for a different architecture. An implementation may now choose
to avoid this problem by returning [EINVAL] when a valid executable for a different architecture is encountered. Some historical
implementations return [EINVAL] to indicate that the <i>path</i> argument contains a character with the high order bit set. The
standard developers chose to deviate from historical practice for the following reasons: 

<ol>
<li>
<p>The new utilization of [EINVAL] will provide some measure of utility to the user community.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Historical use of [EINVAL] is not acceptable in an internationalized operating environment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</dd>

<dt>[ENAMETOOLONG]</dt>

<dd>
Since the file pathname may be constructed by taking elements in the <i>PATH</i> variable and putting them together with the
filename, the [ENAMETOOLONG] error condition could also be reached this way.</dd>

<dt>[ETXTBSY]</dt>

<dd>System V returns this error when the executable file is currently open for writing by some process. This volume of POSIX.1-2017
neither requires nor prohibits this behavior.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Other systems (such as System V) may return [EINTR] from <i>exec</i>. This is not addressed by this volume of POSIX.1-2017, but
implementations may have a window between the call to <i>exec</i> and the time that a signal could cause one of the <i>exec</i>
calls to return with [EINTR].</p>

<p>An explicit statement regarding the floating-point environment (as defined in the <a href=
"../basedefs/fenv.h.html"><i>&lt;fenv.h&gt;</i></a> header) was added to make it clear that the floating-point environment is set
to its default when a call to one of the <i>exec</i> functions succeeds. The requirements for inheritance or setting to the default
for other process and thread start-up functions is covered by more generic statements in their descriptions and can be summarized
as follows:</p>

<dl compact>
<dt><i>posix_spawn</i>()</dt>

<dd>Set to default.</dd>

<dt><i>fork</i>()</dt>

<dd>Inherit.</dd>

<dt><i>pthread_create</i>()</dt>

<dd>Inherit.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The purpose of the <i>fexecve</i>() function is to enable executing a file which has been verified to be the intended file. It
is possible to actively check the file by reading from the file descriptor and be sure that the file is not exchanged for another
between the reading and the execution. Alternatively, a function like <a href="../functions/openat.html"><i>openat</i>()</a> can be
used to open a file which has been found by reading the content of a directory using <a href=
"../functions/readdir.html"><i>readdir</i>()</a>.</p>
