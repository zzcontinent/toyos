<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_16_645_03"></a>DESCRIPTION</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The <i>wait</i>() and <i>waitpid</i>() functions shall obtain status information (see <a href=
"../functions/V2_chap02.html#tag_15_13"><i>Status Information</i></a>) pertaining to one of the caller's child processes. The
<i>wait</i>() function obtains status information for process termination from any child process. The <i>waitpid</i>() function
obtains status information for process termination, and optionally process stop and/or continue, from a specified subset of the
child processes.</p>

<p>The <i>wait</i>() function shall cause the calling thread to become blocked until status information generated by child process
termination is made available to the thread, or until delivery of a signal whose action is either to execute a signal-catching
function or to terminate the process, or an error occurs. If termination status information is available prior to the call to
<i>wait</i>(), return shall be immediate. If termination status information is available for two or more child processes, the order
in which their status is reported is unspecified.</p>

<p>As described in <a href="../functions/V2_chap02.html#tag_15_13"><i>Status Information</i></a>, the <i>wait</i>() and
<i>waitpid</i>() functions consume the status information they obtain.</p>

<p>The behavior when multiple threads are blocked in <i>wait</i>(), <a href="../functions/waitid.html"><i>waitid</i>()</a>, or
<i>waitpid</i>() is described in <a href="../functions/V2_chap02.html#tag_15_13"><i>Status Information</i></a>.</p>

<p>The <i>waitpid</i>() function shall be equivalent to <i>wait</i>() if the <i>pid</i> argument is (<b>pid_t</b>)-1 and the
<i>options</i> argument is 0. Otherwise, its behavior shall be modified by the values of the <i>pid</i> and <i>options</i>
arguments.</p>

<p>The <i>pid</i> argument specifies a set of child processes for which <i>status</i> is requested. The <i>waitpid</i>() function
shall only return the status of a child process from this set:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If <i>pid</i> is equal to (<b>pid_t</b>)-1, <i>status</i> is requested for any child process. In this respect, <i>waitpid</i>()
is then equivalent to <i>wait</i>().</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If <i>pid</i> is greater than 0, it specifies the process ID of a single child process for which <i>status</i> is requested.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If <i>pid</i> is 0, <i>status</i> is requested for any child process whose process group ID is equal to that of the calling
process.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If <i>pid</i> is less than (<b>pid_t</b>)-1, <i>status</i> is requested for any child process whose process group ID is equal to
the absolute value of <i>pid</i>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The <i>options</i> argument is constructed from the bitwise-inclusive OR of zero or more of the following flags, defined in the
<a href="../basedefs/sys_wait.h.html"><i>&lt;sys/wait.h&gt;</i></a> header:</p>

<dl compact>
<dt>WCONTINUED</dt>

<dd><sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('XSI')">XSI</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0">
The <i>waitpid</i>() function shall report the status of any continued child process specified by <i>pid</i> whose status has not
been reported since it continued from a job control stop. <img src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border="0"></dd>

<dt>WNOHANG</dt>

<dd>The <i>waitpid</i>() function shall not suspend execution of the calling thread if <i>status</i> is not immediately available
for one of the child processes specified by <i>pid</i>.</dd>

<dt>WUNTRACED</dt>

<dd>The status of any child processes specified by <i>pid</i> that are stopped, and whose status has not yet been reported since
they stopped, shall also be reported to the requesting process.</dd>
</dl>

<p>If <i>wait</i>() or <i>waitpid</i>() return because the status of a child process is available, these functions shall return a
value equal to the process ID of the child process. In this case, if the value of the argument <i>stat_loc</i> is not a null
pointer, information shall be stored in the location pointed to by <i>stat_loc</i>. The value stored at the location pointed to by
<i>stat_loc</i> shall be 0 if and only if the status returned is from a terminated child process that terminated by one of the
following means:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The process returned 0 from <i>main</i>().</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The process called <a href="../functions/_exit.html"><i>_exit</i>()</a> or <a href="../functions/exit.html"><i>exit</i>()</a>
with a <i>status</i> argument of 0.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The process was terminated because the last thread in the process terminated.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Regardless of its value, this information may be interpreted using the following macros, which are defined in <a href=
"../basedefs/sys_wait.h.html"><i>&lt;sys/wait.h&gt;</i></a> and evaluate to integral expressions; the <i>stat_val</i> argument is
the integer value pointed to by <i>stat_loc</i>.</p>

<dd>
Evaluates to a non-zero value if <i>status</i> was returned for a child process that terminated normally.</dd>

<dt>WEXITSTATUS(<i>stat_val</i>)</dt>

<dd>
If the value of WIFEXITED(<i>stat_val</i>) is non-zero, this macro evaluates to the low-order 8 bits of the <i>status</i> argument
that the child process passed to <a href="../functions/_exit.html"><i>_exit</i>()</a> or <a href=

<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_16_645_07"></a>APPLICATION USAGE</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Calls to <i>wait</i>() will collect information about any child process. This may result in interactions with other interfaces
that may be waiting for their own children (such as by use of <a href="../functions/system.html"><i>system</i>()</a>). For this and
other reasons it is recommended that portable applications not use <i>wait</i>(), but instead use <i>waitpid</i>(). For these same
reasons, the use of <i>waitpid</i>() with a <i>pid</i> argument of -1, and the use of <a href=
"../functions/waitid.html"><i>waitid</i>()</a> with the <i>idtype</i> argument set to P_ALL, are also not recommended for portable
applications.</p>

<p><sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('XSI')">XSI</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0">
As specified in <a href="../functions/_Exit.html#tag_16_01_03_01"><i>Consequences of Process Termination</i></a>, if the calling
process has SA_NOCLDWAIT set or has SIGCHLD set to SIG_IGN, then the termination of a child process will not cause status
information to become available to a thread blocked in <i>wait</i>(), <a href="../functions/waitid.html"><i>waitid</i>()</a>, or
<i>waitpid</i>(). Thus, a thread blocked in one of the wait functions will remain blocked unless some other condition causes the
thread to resume execution (such as an [ECHILD] failure due to no remaining children in the set of waited-for children). <img src=
"../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border="0"></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_16_645_08"></a>RATIONALE</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>A call to the <i>wait</i>() or <i>waitpid</i>() function only returns <i>status</i> on an immediate child process of the calling
process; that is, a child that was produced by a single <a href="../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a> call (perhaps followed
by an <i><a href="../functions/exec.html">exec</a></i> or other function calls) from the parent. If a child produces grandchildren
by further use of <a href="../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a>, none of those grandchildren nor any of their descendants
affect the behavior of a <i>wait</i>() from the original parent process. Nothing in this volume of POSIX.1-2017 prevents an
implementation from providing extensions that permit a process to get <i>status</i> from a grandchild or any other process, but a
process that does not use such extensions must be guaranteed to see <i>status</i> from only its direct children.</p>

<p>The <i>waitpid</i>() function is provided for three reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>To support job control</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>To permit a non-blocking version of the <i>wait</i>() function</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>To permit a library routine, such as <a href="../functions/system.html"><i>system</i>()</a> or <a href=
"../functions/pclose.html"><i>pclose</i>()</a>, to wait for its children without interfering with other terminated children for
which the process has not waited</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The first two of these facilities are based on the <i>wait3</i>() function provided by 4.3 BSD. The function uses the
<i>options</i> argument, which is equivalent to an argument to <i>wait3</i>(). The WUNTRACED flag is used only in conjunction with
job control on systems supporting job control. Its name comes from 4.3 BSD and refers to the fact that there are two types of
stopped processes in that implementation: processes being traced via the <i>ptrace</i>() debugging facility and (untraced)
processes stopped by job control signals. Since <i>ptrace</i>() is not part of this volume of POSIX.1-2017, only the second type is
relevant. The name WUNTRACED was retained because its usage is the same, even though the name is not intuitively meaningful in this
context.</p>

<p>The third reason for the <i>waitpid</i>() function is to permit independent sections of a process to spawn and wait for children
without interfering with each other. For example, the following problem occurs in developing a portable shell, or command
interpreter:</p>

<pre>
<tt>stream = popen("/bin/true");
(void) system("sleep 100");
(void) pclose(stream);
</tt>
</pre>

<p>On all historical implementations, the final <a href="../functions/pclose.html"><i>pclose</i>()</a> fails to reap the
<i>wait</i>() <i>status</i> of the <a href="../functions/popen.html"><i>popen</i>()</a>.</p>

<p>The status values are retrieved by macros, rather than given as specific bit encodings as they are in most historical
implementations (and thus expected by existing programs). This was necessary to eliminate a limitation on the number of signals an
implementation can support that was inherent in the traditional encodings. This volume of POSIX.1-2017 does require that a
<i>status</i> value of zero corresponds to a process calling <i>_exit</i>(0), as this is the most common encoding expected by
existing programs. Some of the macro names were adopted from 4.3 BSD.</p>

<p>These macros syntactically operate on an arbitrary integer value. The behavior is undefined unless that value is one stored by a
successful call to <i>wait</i>() or <i>waitpid</i>() in the location pointed to by the <i>stat_loc</i> argument. An early proposal
attempted to make this clearer by specifying each argument as *<i>stat_loc</i> rather than <i>stat_val</i>. However, that did not
follow the conventions of other specifications in this volume of POSIX.1-2017 or traditional usage. It also could have implied that
the argument to the macro must literally be *<i>stat_loc</i>; in fact, that value can be stored or passed as an argument to other
functions before being interpreted by these macros.</p>

<p>The extension that affects <i>wait</i>() and <i>waitpid</i>() and is common in historical implementations is the <i>ptrace</i>()
function. It is called by a child process and causes that child to stop and return a <i>status</i> that appears identical to the
<i>status</i> indicated by WIFSTOPPED. The <i>status</i> of <i>ptrace</i>() children is traditionally returned regardless of the
WUNTRACED flag (or by the <i>wait</i>() function). Most applications do not need to concern themselves with such extensions because
they have control over what extensions they or their children use. However, applications, such as command interpreters, that invoke
arbitrary processes may see this behavior when those arbitrary processes misuse such extensions.</p>

<p>Implementations that support <b>core</b> file creation or other implementation-defined actions on termination of some processes
traditionally provide a bit in the <i>status</i> returned by <i>wait</i>() to indicate that such actions have occurred.</p>

<p>Allowing the <i>wait</i>() family of functions to discard a pending SIGCHLD signal that is associated with a successfully
waited-for child process puts them into the <a href="../functions/sigwait.html"><i>sigwait</i>()</a> and <a href=
"../functions/sigwaitinfo.html"><i>sigwaitinfo</i>()</a> category with respect to SIGCHLD.</p>

<p>This definition allows implementations to treat a pending SIGCHLD signal as accepted by the process in <i>wait</i>(), with the
same meaning of &quot;accepted&quot; as when that word is applied to the <a href="../functions/sigwait.html"><i>sigwait</i>()</a> family of
functions.</p>

<p>Allowing the <i>wait</i>() family of functions to behave this way permits an implementation to be able to deal precisely with
SIGCHLD signals.</p>

<p>In particular, an implementation that does accept (discard) the SIGCHLD signal can make the following guarantees regardless of
the queuing depth of signals in general (the list of waitable children can hold the SIGCHLD queue):</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>If a SIGCHLD signal handler is established via <a href="../functions/sigaction.html"><i>sigaction</i>()</a> without the
SA_RESETHAND flag, SIGCHLD signals can be accurately counted; that is, exactly one SIGCHLD signal will be delivered to or accepted
by the process for every child process that terminates.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A single <i>wait</i>() issued from a SIGCHLD signal handler can be guaranteed to return immediately with status information for
a child process.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>When SA_SIGINFO is requested, the SIGCHLD signal handler can be guaranteed to receive a non-null pointer to a <b>siginfo_t</b>
structure that describes a child process for which a wait via <i>waitpid</i>() or <a href=
"../functions/waitid.html"><i>waitid</i>()</a> will not block or fail.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The <a href="../functions/system.html"><i>system</i>()</a> function will not cause the SIGCHLD handler of a process to be called
as a result of the <a href="../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a>/ <i><a href="../functions/exec.html">exec</a></i> executed
within <a href="../functions/system.html"><i>system</i>()</a> because <a href="../functions/system.html"><i>system</i>()</a> will
accept the SIGCHLD signal when it performs a <i>waitpid</i>() for its child process. This is a desirable behavior of <a href=
"../functions/system.html"><i>system</i>()</a> so that it can be used in a library without causing side-effects to the application
linked with the library.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>An implementation that does not permit the <i>wait</i>() family of functions to accept (discard) a pending SIGCHLD signal
associated with a successfully waited-for child, cannot make the guarantees described above for the following reasons:</p>

<dl compact>
<dt>Guarantee #1</dt>

<dd>
Although it might be assumed that reliable queuing of all SIGCHLD signals generated by the system can make this guarantee, the
counter-example is the case of a process that blocks SIGCHLD and performs an indefinite loop of <a href=
"../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a>/ <i>wait</i>() operations. If the implementation supports queued signals, then
eventually the system will run out of memory for the queue. The guarantee cannot be made because there must be some limit to the
depth of queuing.</dd>

<dt>Guarantees #2 and #3</dt>

<dd>
These cannot be guaranteed unless the <i>wait</i>() family of functions accepts the SIGCHLD signal. Otherwise, a <a href=
"../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a>/ <i>wait</i>() executed while SIGCHLD is blocked (as in the <a href=
"../functions/system.html"><i>system</i>()</a> function) will result in an invocation of the handler when SIGCHLD is unblocked,
after the process has disappeared.</dd>

<dt>Guarantee #4</dt>

<dd>
Although possible to make this guarantee, <a href="../functions/system.html"><i>system</i>()</a> would have to set the SIGCHLD
handler to SIG_DFL so that the SIGCHLD signal generated by its <a href="../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a> would be
discarded (the SIGCHLD default action is to be ignored), then restore it to its previous setting. This would have the undesirable
side-effect of discarding all SIGCHLD signals pending to the process.</dd>

specifications, it was not required for UNIX applications.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The following changes were made to align with the IEEE&nbsp;P1003.1a draft standard:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The processing of the SIGCHLD signal and the [ECHILD] error is clarified.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The semantics of WIFSTOPPED(<i>stat_val</i>), WIFEXITED(<i>stat_val</i>), and WIFSIGNALED(<i>stat_val</i>) are defined with
respect to <a href="../functions/posix_spawn.html"><i>posix_spawn</i>()</a> or <a href=
"../functions/posix_spawnp.html"><i>posix_spawnp</i>()</a> for alignment with IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1d-1999.</p>

<p>The DESCRIPTION is updated for alignment with the ISO/IEC&nbsp;9899:1999 standard.</p>

<p>IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001/Cor&nbsp;2-2004, item XSH/TC2/D6/145 is applied, adding the example to the EXAMPLES section.</p>
