<blockquote>
<p>The <i>fork</i>() function shall create a new process. The new process (child process) shall be an exact copy of the calling
process (parent process) except as detailed below:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The child process shall have a unique process ID.</p>

<li>
<p>Memory mappings created in the parent shall be retained in the child process. MAP_PRIVATE mappings inherited from the parent
shall also be MAP_PRIVATE mappings in the child, and any modifications to the data in these mappings made by the parent prior to
calling <i>fork</i>() shall be visible to the child. Any modifications to the data in MAP_PRIVATE mappings made by the parent after

<p>When the application calls <i>fork</i>() from a signal handler and any of the fork handlers registered by <a href=

<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_16_156_08"></a>RATIONALE</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Many historical implementations have timing windows where a signal sent to a process group (for example, an interactive SIGINT)
just prior to or during execution of <i>fork</i>() is delivered to the parent following the <i>fork</i>() but not to the child
because the <i>fork</i>() code clears the child's set of pending signals. This volume of POSIX.1-2017 does not require, or even
permit, this behavior. However, it is pragmatic to expect that problems of this nature may continue to exist in implementations
that appear to conform to this volume of POSIX.1-2017 and pass available verification suites. This behavior is only a consequence
of the implementation failing to make the interval between signal generation and delivery totally invisible. From the application's
perspective, a <i>fork</i>() call should appear atomic. A signal that is generated prior to the <i>fork</i>() should be delivered
prior to the <i>fork</i>(). A signal sent to the process group after the <i>fork</i>() should be delivered to both parent and
child. The implementation may actually initialize internal data structures corresponding to the child's set of pending signals to
include signals sent to the process group during the <i>fork</i>(). Since the <i>fork</i>() call can be considered as atomic from
the application's perspective, the set would be initialized as empty and such signals would have arrived after the <i>fork</i>();
see also <a href="../basedefs/signal.h.html"><i>&lt;signal.h&gt;</i></a>.</p>

<p>One approach that has been suggested to address the problem of signal inheritance across <i>fork</i>() is to add an [EINTR]
error, which would be returned when a signal is detected during the call. While this is preferable to losing signals, it was not
considered an optimal solution. Although it is not recommended for this purpose, such an error would be an allowable extension for
an implementation.</p>

<p>The [ENOMEM] error value is reserved for those implementations that detect and distinguish such a condition. This condition
occurs when an implementation detects that there is not enough memory to create the process. This is intended to be returned when
[EAGAIN] is inappropriate because there can never be enough memory (either primary or secondary storage) to perform the operation.
Since <i>fork</i>() duplicates an existing process, this must be a condition where there is sufficient memory for one such process,
but not for two. Many historical implementations actually return [ENOMEM] due to temporary lack of memory, a case that is not
generally distinct from [EAGAIN] from the perspective of a conforming application.</p>

<p>Part of the reason for including the optional error [ENOMEM] is because the SVID specifies it and it should be reserved for the
error condition specified there. The condition is not applicable on many implementations.</p>

<p>IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-1988 neglected to require concurrent execution of the parent and child of <i>fork</i>(). A system that
single-threads processes was clearly not intended and is considered an unacceptable &quot;toy implementation&quot; of this volume of
POSIX.1-2017. The only objection anticipated to the phrase &quot;executing independently&quot; is testability, but this assertion should be
testable. Such tests require that both the parent and child can block on a detectable action of the other, such as a write to a
pipe or a signal. An interactive exchange of such actions should be possible for the system to conform to the intent of this volume
of POSIX.1-2017.</p>

<p>The [EAGAIN] error exists to warn applications that such a condition might occur. Whether it occurs or not is not in any
practical sense under the control of the application because the condition is usually a consequence of the user's use of the
system, not of the application's code. Thus, no application can or should rely upon its occurrence under any circumstances, nor
should the exact semantics of what concept of &quot;user&quot; is used be of concern to the application developer. Validation writers
should be cognizant of this limitation.</p>

<p>There are two reasons why POSIX programmers call <i>fork</i>(). One reason is to create a new thread of control within the same
program (which was originally only possible in POSIX by creating a new process); the other is to create a new process running a
different program. In the latter case, the call to <i>fork</i>() is soon followed by a call to one of the <i><a href=
"../functions/exec.html">exec</a></i> functions.</p>

<p>The general problem with making <i>fork</i>() work in a multi-threaded world is what to do with all of the threads. There are
two alternatives. One is to copy all of the threads into the new process. This causes the programmer or implementation to deal with
threads that are suspended on system calls or that might be about to execute system calls that should not be executed in the new
process. The other alternative is to copy only the thread that calls <i>fork</i>(). This creates the difficulty that the state of
process-local resources is usually held in process memory. If a thread that is not calling <i>fork</i>() holds a resource, that
resource is never released in the child process because the thread whose job it is to release the resource does not exist in the
child process.</p>

<p>When a programmer is writing a multi-threaded program, the first described use of <i>fork</i>(), creating new threads in the
same program, is provided by the <a href="../functions/pthread_create.html"><i>pthread_create</i>()</a> function. The <i>fork</i>()
function is thus used only to run new programs, and the effects of calling functions that require certain resources between the
call to <i>fork</i>() and the call to an <i><a href="../functions/exec.html">exec</a></i> function are undefined.</p>

<p>The addition of the <i>forkall</i>() function to the standard was considered and rejected. The <i>forkall</i>() function lets
all the threads in the parent be duplicated in the child. This essentially duplicates the state of the parent in the child. This
allows threads in the child to continue processing and allows locks and the state to be preserved without explicit <a href=
"../functions/pthread_atfork.html"><i>pthread_atfork</i>()</a> code. The calling process has to ensure that the threads processing
state that is shared between the parent and child (that is, file descriptors or MAP_SHARED memory) behaves properly after
<i>forkall</i>(). For example, if a thread is reading a file descriptor in the parent when <i>forkall</i>() is called, then two
threads (one in the parent and one in the child) are reading the file descriptor after the <i>forkall</i>(). If this is not desired
behavior, the parent process has to synchronize with such threads before calling <i>forkall</i>().</p>

<p>While the <i>fork</i>() function is async-signal-safe, there is no way for an implementation to determine whether the fork
handlers established by <a href="../functions/pthread_atfork.html"><i>pthread_atfork</i>()</a> are async-signal-safe. The fork
handlers may attempt to execute portions of the implementation that are not async-signal-safe, such as those that are protected by
mutexes, leading to a deadlock condition. It is therefore undefined for the fork handlers to execute functions that are not
async-signal-safe when <i>fork</i>() is called from a signal handler.</p>

<p>When <i>forkall</i>() is called, threads, other than the calling thread, that are in functions that can return with an [EINTR]
error may have those functions return [EINTR] if the implementation cannot ensure that the function behaves correctly in the parent
and child. In particular, <a href="../functions/pthread_cond_wait.html"><i>pthread_cond_wait</i>()</a> and <a href=
"../functions/pthread_cond_timedwait.html"><i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>()</a> need to return in order to ensure that the condition
has not changed. These functions can be awakened by a spurious condition wakeup rather than returning [EINTR].</p>
