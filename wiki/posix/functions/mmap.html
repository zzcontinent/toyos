<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_16_332_03"></a>DESCRIPTION</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The <i>mmap</i>() function shall establish a mapping between an address space of a process and a memory object.</p>

<p>The <i>mmap</i>() function shall be supported for the following memory objects:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Regular files</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('SHM')">SHM</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0">
Shared memory objects <img src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border="0"></p>
</li>

<li>
<p><sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('TYM')">TYM</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0">
Typed memory objects <img src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border="0"></p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Support for any other type of file is unspecified.</p>

<p>The format of the call is as follows:</p>

<pre>
<i>pa</i><tt>=</tt><i>mmap</i><tt>(</tt><i>addr</i><tt>,</tt> <i>len</i><tt>,</tt> <i>prot</i><tt>,</tt> <i>flags</i><tt>,</tt> <i>fildes</i><tt>,</tt> <i>off</i><tt>);
</tt>
</pre>

<p>The <i>mmap</i>() function shall establish a mapping between the address space of the process at an address <i>pa</i> for
<i>len</i> bytes to the memory object represented by the file descriptor <i>fildes</i> at offset <i>off</i> for <i>len</i> bytes.
The value of <i>pa</i> is an implementation-defined function of the parameter <i>addr</i> and the values of <i>flags</i>, further
described below. A successful <i>mmap</i>() call shall return <i>pa</i> as its result. The address range starting at <i>pa</i> and
continuing for <i>len</i> bytes shall be legitimate for the possible (not necessarily current) address space of the process. The
range of bytes starting at <i>off</i> and continuing for <i>len</i> bytes shall be legitimate for the possible (not necessarily
current) offsets in the memory object represented by <i>fildes</i>.</p>

<p><sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('TYM')">TYM</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0">
If <i>fildes</i> represents a typed memory object opened with either the POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE flag or the
POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE_CONTIG flag, the memory object to be mapped shall be that portion of the typed memory object allocated by
the implementation as specified below. In this case, if <i>off</i> is non-zero, the behavior of <i>mmap</i>() is undefined. If
<i>fildes</i> refers to a valid typed memory object that is not accessible from the calling process, <i>mmap</i>() shall fail. <img
src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border="0"></p>

<p>The mapping established by <i>mmap</i>() shall replace any previous mappings for those whole pages containing any part of the
address space of the process starting at <i>pa</i> and continuing for <i>len</i> bytes.</p>

<p>If the size of the mapped file changes after the call to <i>mmap</i>() as a result of some other operation on the mapped file,
the effect of references to portions of the mapped region that correspond to added or removed portions of the file is
unspecified.</p>

<p>If <i>len</i> is zero, <i>mmap</i>() shall fail and no mapping shall be established.</p>

<p>The parameter <i>prot</i> determines whether read, write, execute, or some combination of accesses are permitted to the data
being mapped. The <i>prot</i> shall be either PROT_NONE or the bitwise-inclusive OR of one or more of the other flags in the
following table, defined in the <a href="../basedefs/sys_mman.h.html"><i>&lt;sys/mman.h&gt;</i></a> header.</p>

</center>

<p>If an implementation cannot support the combination of access types specified by <i>prot</i>, the call to <i>mmap</i>() shall
fail.</p>

<p>An implementation may permit accesses other than those specified by <i>prot</i>; however, the implementation shall not permit a
write to succeed where PROT_WRITE has not been set and shall not permit any access where PROT_NONE alone has been set. The
implementation shall support at least the following values of <i>prot</i>: PROT_NONE, PROT_READ, PROT_WRITE, and the
bitwise-inclusive OR of PROT_READ and PROT_WRITE. The file descriptor <i>fildes</i> shall have been opened with read permission,
regardless of the protection options specified. If PROT_WRITE is specified, the application shall ensure that it has opened the
file descriptor <i>fildes</i> with write permission unless MAP_PRIVATE is specified in the <i>flags</i> parameter as described
below.</p>

<p>The parameter <i>flags</i> provides other information about the handling of the mapped data. The value of <i>flags</i> is the
bitwise-inclusive OR of these options, defined in <a href="../basedefs/sys_mman.h.html"><i>&lt;sys/mman.h&gt;</i></a>:</p>

<p>It is implementation-defined whether MAP_FIXED shall be supported. <sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('XSI')">XSI</a>]</sup>
<img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0"> &nbsp;MAP_FIXED shall be supported on XSI-conformant systems.
<img src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border="0"></p>

<p>MAP_SHARED and MAP_PRIVATE describe the disposition of write references to the memory object. If MAP_SHARED is specified, write
references shall change the underlying object. If MAP_PRIVATE is specified, modifications to the mapped data by the calling process
shall be visible only to the calling process and shall not change the underlying object. It is unspecified whether modifications to
the underlying object done after the MAP_PRIVATE mapping is established are visible through the MAP_PRIVATE mapping. Either
MAP_SHARED or MAP_PRIVATE can be specified, but not both. The mapping type is retained across <a href=
"../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a>.</p>

<p>The state of synchronization objects such as mutexes, semaphores, barriers, and conditional variables placed in shared memory
mapped with MAP_SHARED becomes undefined when the last region in any process containing the synchronization object is unmapped.</p>

<p><sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('TYM')">TYM</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0">
When <i>fildes</i> represents a typed memory object opened with either the POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE flag or the
POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE_CONTIG flag, <i>mmap</i>() shall, if there are enough resources available, map <i>len</i> bytes allocated
from the corresponding typed memory object which were not previously allocated to any process in any processor that may access that
typed memory object. If there are not enough resources available, the function shall fail. If <i>fildes</i> represents a typed
memory object opened with the POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE_CONTIG flag, these allocated bytes shall be contiguous within the typed
memory object. If <i>fildes</i> represents a typed memory object opened with the POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE flag, these allocated
bytes may be composed of non-contiguous fragments within the typed memory object. If <i>fildes</i> represents a typed memory object
opened with neither the POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE_CONTIG flag nor the POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE flag, <i>len</i> bytes starting at
offset <i>off</i> within the typed memory object are mapped, exactly as when mapping a file or shared memory object. In this case,
if two processes map an area of typed memory using the same <i>off</i> and <i>len</i> values and using file descriptors that refer
to the same memory pool (either from the same port or from a different port), both processes shall map the same region of storage.
<img src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border="0"></p>

<p>When MAP_FIXED is set in the <i>flags</i> argument, the implementation is informed that the value of <i>pa</i> shall be
<i>addr</i>, exactly. If MAP_FIXED is set, <i>mmap</i>() may return MAP_FAILED and set <i>errno</i> to [EINVAL]. If a MAP_FIXED
request is successful, then any previous mappings <sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('ML')">ML|MLR</a>]</sup> <img src=
"../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0"> &nbsp;or memory locks <img src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt=
"[Option End]" border="0"> &nbsp;for those whole pages containing any part of the address range [<i>pa</i>,<i>pa</i>+<i>len</i>)
shall be removed, as if by an appropriate call to <a href="../functions/munmap.html"><i>munmap</i>()</a>, before the new mapping is
established.</p>

<p>When MAP_FIXED is not set, the implementation uses <i>addr</i> in an implementation-defined manner to arrive at <i>pa</i>. The
<i>pa</i> so chosen shall be an area of the address space that the implementation deems suitable for a mapping of <i>len</i> bytes
to the file. All implementations interpret an <i>addr</i> value of 0 as granting the implementation complete freedom in selecting
<i>pa</i>, subject to constraints described below. A non-zero value of <i>addr</i> is taken to be a suggestion of a process address
near which the mapping should be placed. When the implementation selects a value for <i>pa</i>, it never places a mapping at
address 0, nor does it replace any extant mapping.</p>

<p>If MAP_FIXED is specified and <i>addr</i> is non-zero, it shall have the same remainder as the <i>off</i> parameter, modulo the
page size as returned by <a href="../functions/sysconf.html"><i>sysconf</i>()</a> when passed _SC_PAGESIZE or _SC_PAGE_SIZE. The
implementation may require that off is a multiple of the page size. If MAP_FIXED is specified, the implementation may require that
<i>addr</i> is a multiple of the page size. The system performs mapping operations over whole pages. Thus, while the parameter
<i>len</i> need not meet a size or alignment constraint, the system shall include, in any mapping operation, any partial page
specified by the address range starting at <i>pa</i> and continuing for <i>len</i> bytes.</p>

<p>The system shall always zero-fill any partial page at the end of an object. Further, the system shall never write out any
modified portions of the last page of an object which are beyond its end. References within the address range starting at <i>pa</i>
and continuing for <i>len</i> bytes to whole pages following the end of an object shall result in delivery of a SIGBUS signal.</p>

<p>An implementation may generate SIGBUS signals when a reference would cause an error in the mapped object, such as out-of-space
condition.</p>

<p>The <i>mmap</i>() function shall add an extra reference to the file associated with the file descriptor <i>fildes</i> which is
not removed by a subsequent <a href="../functions/close.html"><i>close</i>()</a> on that file descriptor. This reference shall be
removed when there are no more mappings to the file.</p>

<p>The last data access timestamp of the mapped file may be marked for update at any time between the <i>mmap</i>() call and the
corresponding <a href="../functions/munmap.html"><i>munmap</i>()</a> call. The initial read or write reference to a mapped region
shall cause the file's last data access timestamp to be marked for update if it has not already been marked for update.</p>

<p>The last data modification and last file status change timestamps of a file that is mapped with MAP_SHARED and PROT_WRITE shall
be marked for update at some point in the interval between a write reference to the mapped region and the next call to <a href=
"../functions/msync.html"><i>msync</i>()</a> with MS_ASYNC or MS_SYNC for that portion of the file by any process. If there is no
such call and if the underlying file is modified as a result of a write reference, then these timestamps shall be marked for update
at some time after the write reference.</p>

<p>There may be implementation-defined limits on the number of memory regions that can be mapped (per process or per system).</p>

<p>None.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_16_332_07"></a>APPLICATION USAGE</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Use of <i>mmap</i>() may reduce the amount of memory available to other memory allocation functions.</p>

<p>Use of MAP_FIXED may result in unspecified behavior in further use of <a href="../functions/malloc.html"><i>malloc</i>()</a> and
<a href="../functions/shmat.html"><i>shmat</i>()</a>. The use of MAP_FIXED is discouraged, as it may prevent an implementation from
making the most effective use of resources. Most implementations require that <i>off</i> and <i>addr</i> are multiples of the page
size as returned by <a href="../functions/sysconf.html"><i>sysconf</i>()</a>.</p>

<p>The application must ensure correct synchronization when using <i>mmap</i>() in conjunction with any other file access method,
such as <a href="../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a> and <a href="../functions/write.html"><i>write</i>()</a>, standard
input/output, and <a href="../functions/shmat.html"><i>shmat</i>()</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>mmap</i>() function allows access to resources via address space manipulations, instead of <a href=
"../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a>/ <a href="../functions/write.html"><i>write</i>()</a>. Once a file is mapped, all a
process has to do to access it is use the data at the address to which the file was mapped. So, using pseudo-code to illustrate the
way in which an existing program might be changed to use <i>mmap</i>(), the following:</p>

<pre>
<tt>fildes = open(...)
lseek(fildes, some_offset)
read(fildes, buf, len)
/* Use data in buf. */
</tt>
</pre>

<p>becomes:</p>

<pre>
<tt>fildes = open(...)
address = mmap(0, len, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, fildes, some_offset)
/* Use data at address. */
</tt>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_16_332_08"></a>RATIONALE</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>After considering several other alternatives, it was decided to adopt the <i>mmap</i>() definition found in SVR4 for mapping
memory objects into process address spaces. The SVR4 definition is minimal, in that it describes only what has been built, and what
appears to be necessary for a general and portable mapping facility.</p>

<p>Note that while <i>mmap</i>() was first designed for mapping files, it is actually a general-purpose mapping facility. It can be
used to map any appropriate object, such as memory, files, devices, and so on, into the address space of a process.</p>

<p>When a mapping is established, it is possible that the implementation may need to map more than is requested into the address
space of the process because of hardware requirements. An application, however, cannot count on this behavior. Implementations that
do not use a paged architecture may simply allocate a common memory region and return the address of it; such implementations
probably do not allocate any more than is necessary. References past the end of the requested area are unspecified.</p>

<p>If an application requests a mapping that overlaps existing mappings in the process, it might be desirable that an
implementation detect this and inform the application. However, if the program specifies a fixed address mapping (which requires
some implementation knowledge to determine a suitable address, if the function is supported at all), then the program is presumed
to be successfully managing its own address space and should be trusted when it asks to map over existing data structures.
Furthermore, it is also desirable to make as few system calls as possible, and it might be considered onerous to require an <a
href="../functions/munmap.html"><i>munmap</i>()</a> before an <i>mmap</i>() to the same address range. This volume of POSIX.1-2017
specifies that the new mapping replaces any existing mappings (implying an automatic <a href=
"../functions/munmap.html"><i>munmap</i>()</a> on the address range), following existing practice in this regard. The standard
developers also considered whether there should be a way for new mappings to overlay existing mappings, but found no existing
practice for this.</p>

<p>It is not expected that all hardware implementations are able to support all combinations of permissions at all addresses.
Implementations are required to disallow write access to mappings without write permission and to disallow access to mappings
without any access permission. Other than these restrictions, implementations may allow access types other than those requested by
the application. For example, if the application requests only PROT_WRITE, the implementation may also allow read access. A call to
<i>mmap</i>() fails if the implementation cannot support allowing all the access requested by the application. For example, some
implementations cannot support a request for both write access and execute access simultaneously. All implementations must support
requests for no access, read access, write access, and both read and write access. Strictly conforming code must only rely on the
required checks. These restrictions allow for portability across a wide range of hardware.</p>

<p>The MAP_FIXED address treatment is likely to fail for non-page-aligned values and for certain architecture-dependent address
ranges. Conforming implementations cannot count on being able to choose address values for MAP_FIXED without utilizing
non-portable, implementation-defined knowledge. Nonetheless, MAP_FIXED is provided as a standard interface conforming to existing
practice for utilizing such knowledge when it is available.</p>

<p>Similarly, in order to allow implementations that do not support virtual addresses, support for directly specifying any mapping
addresses via MAP_FIXED is not required and thus a conforming application may not count on it.</p>

<p>The MAP_PRIVATE function can be implemented efficiently when memory protection hardware is available. When such hardware is not
available, implementations can implement such &quot;mappings&quot; by simply making a real copy of the relevant data into process private
memory, though this tends to behave similarly to <a href="../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a>.</p>

<p>The function has been defined to allow for many different models of using shared memory. However, all uses are not equally
portable across all machine architectures. In particular, the <i>mmap</i>() function allows the system as well as the application
to specify the address at which to map a specific region of a memory object. The most portable way to use the function is always to
let the system choose the address, specifying NULL as the value for the argument <i>addr</i> and not to specify MAP_FIXED.</p>

<p>If it is intended that a particular region of a memory object be mapped at the same address in a group of processes (on machines
where this is even possible), then MAP_FIXED can be used to pass in the desired mapping address. The system can still be used to
choose the desired address if the first such mapping is made without specifying MAP_FIXED, and then the resulting mapping address
can be passed to subsequent processes for them to pass in via MAP_FIXED. The availability of a specific address range cannot be
guaranteed, in general.</p>

<p>The <i>mmap</i>() function can be used to map a region of memory that is larger than the current size of the object. Memory
access within the mapping but beyond the current end of the underlying objects may result in SIGBUS signals being sent to the
process. The reason for this is that the size of the object can be manipulated by other processes and can change at any moment. The
implementation should tell the application that a memory reference is outside the object where this can be detected; otherwise,
written data may be lost and read data may not reflect actual data in the object.</p>

<p>Note that references beyond the end of the object do not extend the object as the new end cannot be determined precisely by most
virtual memory hardware. Instead, the size can be directly manipulated by <a href=
"../functions/ftruncate.html"><i>ftruncate</i>()</a>.</p>

<p>Process memory locking does apply to shared memory regions, and the MCL_FUTURE argument to <a href=
"../functions/mlockall.html"><i>mlockall</i>()</a> can be relied upon to cause new shared memory regions to be automatically
locked.</p>

<p>Existing implementations of <i>mmap</i>() return the value -1 when unsuccessful. Since the casting of this value to type <b>void
*</b> cannot be guaranteed by the ISO&nbsp;C standard to be distinct from a successful value, this volume of POSIX.1-2017 defines
the symbol MAP_FAILED, which a conforming implementation does not return as the result of a successful call.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First released in Issue 4, Version 2.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_16_332_12"></a>Issue 5</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Moved from X/OPEN UNIX extension to BASE.</p>

<p>Aligned with <i>mmap</i>() in the POSIX Realtime Extension as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The DESCRIPTION is extensively reworded.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The [EAGAIN] and [ENOTSUP] mandatory error conditions are added.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>New cases of [ENOMEM] and [ENXIO] are added as mandatory error conditions.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The value returned on failure is the value of the constant MAP_FAILED; this was previously defined as -1.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Large File Summit extensions are added.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_16_332_13"></a>Issue 6</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The <i>mmap</i>() function is marked as part of the Memory Mapped Files option.</p>

<p>The Open Group Corrigendum U028/6 is applied, changing (<b>void</b>&nbsp;*)-1 to MAP_FAILED.</p>

<p>The following new requirements on POSIX implementations derive from alignment with the Single UNIX Specification:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The DESCRIPTION is updated to describe the use of MAP_FIXED.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The DESCRIPTION is updated to describe the addition of an extra reference to the file associated with the file descriptor passed
to <i>mmap</i>().</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The DESCRIPTION is updated to state that there may be implementation-defined limits on the number of memory regions that can be
mapped.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The DESCRIPTION is updated to describe constraints on the alignment and size of the <i>off</i> argument.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The [EINVAL] and [EMFILE] error conditions are added.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The [EOVERFLOW] error condition is added. This change is to support large files.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<br>
<p>The following changes are made for alignment with the ISO&nbsp;POSIX-1:1996 standard:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The DESCRIPTION is updated to describe the cases when MAP_PRIVATE and MAP_FIXED need not be supported.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The following changes are made for alignment with IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1j-2000:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Semantics for typed memory objects are added to the DESCRIPTION.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>New [ENOMEM] and [ENXIO] errors are added to the ERRORS section.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The <a href="../functions/posix_typed_mem_open.html"><i>posix_typed_mem_open</i>()</a> function is added to the SEE ALSO
section.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The normative text is updated to avoid use of the term &quot;must&quot; for application requirements.</p>

<p>IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001/Cor&nbsp;1-2002, item XSH/TC1/D6/34 is applied, changing the margin code in the SYNOPSIS from
MF|SHM to MC3 (notation for MF|SHM|TYM).</p>

<p>IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001/Cor&nbsp;2-2004, item XSH/TC2/D6/60 is applied, updating the DESCRIPTION and ERRORS sections to
add the [EINVAL] error when <i>len</i> is zero.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_16_332_14"></a>Issue 7</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Austin Group Interpretations 1003.1-2001 #078 and #079 are applied, clarifying page alignment requirements and adding a note
about the state of synchronization objects becoming undefined when a shared region is unmapped.</p>

<p>Functionality relating to the Memory Protection and Memory Mapped Files options is moved to the Base.</p>

<p>Changes are made related to support for finegrained timestamps.</p>

<p>POSIX.1-2008, Technical Corrigendum 2, XSH/TC2-2008/0229 [852] is applied.</p>
