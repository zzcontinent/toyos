<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_20_05_03"></a>DESCRIPTION</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The <i>at</i> utility shall read commands from standard input and group them together as an <i>at-job</i>, to be executed at a
later time.</p>

<p>The at-job shall be executed in a separate invocation of the shell, running in a separate process group with no controlling
terminal, except that the environment variables, current working directory, file creation mask, and other implementation-defined
execution-time attributes in effect when the <i>at</i> utility is executed shall be retained and used when the at-job is
executed.</p>

<p>When the at-job is submitted, the <i>at_job_id</i> and scheduled time shall be written to standard error. The <i>at_job_id</i>
is an identifier that shall be a string consisting solely of alphanumeric characters and the &lt;period&gt; character. The
<i>at_job_id</i> shall be assigned by the system when the job is scheduled such that it uniquely identifies a particular job.</p>

<p>User notification and the processing of the job's standard output and standard error are described under the <b>-m</b>
option.</p>

<p><sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('XSI')">XSI</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0">
Users shall be permitted to use <i>at</i> if their name appears in the file <b>at.allow</b> which is located in an
implementation-defined directory. If that file does not exist, the file <b>at.deny</b>, which is located in an
implementation-defined directory, shall be checked to determine whether the user shall be denied access to <i>at</i>. If neither
file exists, only a process with appropriate privileges shall be allowed to submit a job. If only <b>at.deny</b> exists and is
empty, global usage shall be permitted. The <b>at.allow</b> and <b>at.deny</b> files shall consist of one user name per line. <img
src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border="0"></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_20_05_04"></a>OPTIONS</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The <i>at</i> utility shall conform to XBD <a href="../basedefs/V1_chap12.html#tag_12_02"><i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i></a>
.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<dl compact>
<dt><b>-f&nbsp;</b> <i>file</i></dt>

<dd>Specify the pathname of a file to be used as the source of the at-job, instead of standard input.</dd>

<dt><b>-l</b></dt>

<dd>(The letter ell.) Report all jobs scheduled for the invoking user if no <i>at_job_id</i> operands are specified. If
<i>at_job_id</i>s are specified, report only information for these jobs. The output shall be written to standard output.</dd>

<dt><b>-m</b></dt>

<dd>Send mail to the invoking user after the at-job has run, announcing its completion. Standard output and standard error produced
by the at-job shall be mailed to the user as well, unless redirected elsewhere. Mail shall be sent even if the job produces no
output. 

<p>If <b>-m</b> is not used, the job's standard output and standard error shall be provided to the user by means of mail, unless
they are redirected elsewhere; if there is no such output to provide, the implementation need not notify the user of the job's
completion.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>-q&nbsp;</b> <i>queuename</i></dt>

<dd>
Specify in which queue to schedule a job for submission. When used with the <b>-l</b> option, limit the search to that particular
queue. By default, at-jobs shall be scheduled in queue <i>a</i>. In contrast, queue <i>b</i> shall be reserved for batch jobs; see
<a href="../utilities/batch.html"><i>batch</i></a>. The meanings of all other <i>queuename</i>s are implementation-defined. If
<b>-q</b> is specified along with either of the <b>-t</b> <i>time_arg</i> or <i>timespec</i> arguments, the results are
unspecified.</dd>

<dt><b>-r</b></dt>

<dd>Remove the jobs with the specified <i>at_job_id</i> operands that were previously scheduled by the <i>at</i> utility.</dd>

<dt><b>-t&nbsp;</b> <i>time_arg</i></dt>

<dd>Submit the job to be run at the time specified by the <i>time</i> option-argument, which the application shall ensure has the
format as specified by the <a href="../utilities/touch.html"><i>touch</i></a> <b>-t</b> <i>time</i> utility.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>

<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_20_05_05"></a>OPERANDS</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<dl compact>
<dt><i>at_job_id</i></dt>

<dd>The name reported by a previous invocation of the <i>at</i> utility at the time the job was scheduled.</dd>

<dt><i>timespec</i></dt>

<dd>Submit the job to be run at the date and time specified. All of the <i>timespec</i> operands are interpreted as if they were
separated by &lt;space&gt; characters and concatenated, and shall be parsed as described in the grammar at the end of this section.
The date and time shall be interpreted as being in the timezone of the user (as determined by the <i>TZ</i> variable), unless a
timezone name appears as part of <i>time</i>, below. 

<p>In the POSIX locale, the following describes the three parts of the time specification string. All of the values from the
<i>LC_TIME</i> categories in the POSIX locale shall be recognized in a case-insensitive manner.</p>

<dl compact>
<dt><i>time</i></dt>

<dd>The time can be specified as one, two, or four digits. One-digit and two-digit numbers shall be taken to be hours; four-digit
numbers to be hours and minutes. The time can alternatively be specified as two numbers separated by a &lt;colon&gt;, meaning
<i>hour</i>:<i>minute</i>. An AM/PM indication (one of the values from the <b>am_pm</b> keywords in the <i>LC_TIME</i> locale
category) can follow the time; otherwise, a 24-hour clock time shall be understood. A timezone name can also follow to further
qualify the time. The acceptable timezone names are implementation-defined, except that they shall be case-insensitive and the
string <b>utc</b> is supported to indicate the time is in Coordinated Universal Time. In the POSIX locale, the <i>time</i> field
can also be one of the following tokens: 

<dl compact>
<dt><b>midnight</b></dt>

<dd>Indicates the time 12:00 am (00:00).</dd>

<dt><b>noon</b></dt>

<dd>Indicates the time 12:00 pm.</dd>

<dt><b>now</b></dt>

<dd>Indicates the current day and time. Invoking <i>at</i> &lt;<b>now</b>&gt; shall submit an at-job for potentially immediate
execution (that is, subject only to unspecified scheduling delays).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dt><i>date</i></dt>

<dd>An optional <i>date</i> can be specified as either a month name (one of the values from the <b>mon</b> or <b>abmon</b> keywords
in the <i>LC_TIME</i> locale category) followed by a day number (and possibly year number preceded by a comma), or a day of the
week (one of the values from the <b>day</b> or <b>abday</b> keywords in the <i>LC_TIME</i> locale category). In the POSIX locale,
two special days shall be recognized: 

<dl compact>
<dt><b>today</b></dt>

<dd>Indicates the current day.</dd>

<dt><b>tomorrow</b></dt>

<dd>Indicates the day following the current day.</dd>
</dl>

<p>If no <i>date</i> is given, <b>today</b> shall be assumed if the given time is greater than the current time, and
<b>tomorrow</b> shall be assumed if it is less. If the given month is less than the current month (and no year is given), next year
shall be assumed.</p>
</dd>

<dt><i>increment</i></dt>

<dd>The optional <i>increment</i> shall be a number preceded by a &lt;plus-sign&gt; ( <tt>'+'</tt> ) and suffixed by one of the
following: <b>minutes</b>, <b>hours</b>, <b>days</b>, <b>weeks</b>, <b>months</b>, or <b>years</b>. (The singular forms shall also
be accepted.) The keyword <b>next</b> shall be equivalent to an increment number of +1. For example, the following are equivalent
commands: 

<pre>
<tt>at 2pm + 1 week
at 2pm next week
</tt>
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The following grammar describes the precise format of <i>timespec</i> in the POSIX locale. The general conventions for this
style of grammar are described in <a href="../utilities/V3_chap01.html#tag_17_03"><i>Grammar Conventions</i></a>. This formal
syntax shall take precedence over the preceding text syntax description. The longest possible token or delimiter shall be
recognized at a given point. When used in a <i>timespec</i>, white space shall also delimit tokens.</p>

<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_20_05_16"></a>APPLICATION USAGE</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The format of the <i>at</i> command line shown here is guaranteed only for the POSIX locale. Other cultures may be supported
with substantially different interfaces, although implementations are encouraged to provide comparable levels of functionality.</p>

<p>Since the commands run in a separate shell invocation, running in a separate process group with no controlling terminal, open
file descriptors, traps, and priority inherited from the invoking environment are lost.</p>

<p>Some implementations do not allow substitution of different shells using <i>SHELL.</i> System V systems, for example, have used
the login shell value for the user in <b>/etc/passwd</b>. To select reliably another command interpreter, the user must include it
as part of the script, such as:</p>

<pre>
<b>$</b> <tt>at 1800
myshell myscript
EOT
</tt><b>job ... at ...
$</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_20_05_17"></a>EXAMPLES</h4>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>This sequence can be used at a terminal:</p>

<pre>
<tt>at -m 0730 tomorrow
sort &lt; file &gt;outfile
EOT
</tt>
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<p>This sequence, which demonstrates redirecting standard error to a pipe, is useful in a command procedure (the sequence of output
redirection specifications is significant):</p>

<pre>
<tt>at now + 1 hour &lt;&lt;!
diff file1 file2 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt;outfile | mailx mygroup
!
</tt>
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<p>To have a job reschedule itself, <i>at</i> can be invoked from within the at-job. For example, this daily processing script
named <b>my.daily</b> runs every day (although <a href="../utilities/crontab.html"><i>crontab</i></a> is a more appropriate vehicle
for such work):</p>

<pre>
<tt># my.daily runs every day
</tt><i>daily processing</i><tt>at now tomorrow &lt; my.daily
</tt>
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<p>The spacing of the three portions of the POSIX locale <i>timespec</i> is quite flexible as long as there are no ambiguities.
Examples of various times and operand presentation include:</p>

<pre>

<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_20_05_18"></a>RATIONALE</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The <i>at</i> utility reads from standard input the commands to be executed at a later time. It may be useful to redirect
standard output and standard error within the specified commands.</p>

<p>The <b>-t</b> <i>time</i> option was added as a new capability to support an internationalized way of specifying a time for
execution of the submitted job.</p>

<p>Early proposals added a &quot;jobname&quot; concept as a way of giving submitted jobs names that are meaningful to the user submitting
them. The historical, system-specified <i>at_job_id</i> gives no indication of what the job is. Upon further reflection, it was
decided that the benefit of this was not worth the change in historical interface. The <i>at</i> functionality is useful in simple
environments, but in large or complex situations, the functionality provided by the Batch Services option is more suitable.</p>

<p>The <b>-q</b> option historically has been an undocumented option, used mainly by the <a href=
"../utilities/batch.html"><i>batch</i></a> utility.</p>

<p>The System V <b>-m</b> option was added to provide a method for informing users that an at-job had completed. Otherwise, users
are only informed when output to standard error or standard output are not redirected.</p>

<p>The behavior of <i>at</i> &lt;<b>now</b>&gt; was changed in an early proposal from being unspecified to submitting a job for
potentially immediate execution. Historical BSD <i>at</i> implementations support this. Historical System V implementations give an
error in that case, but a change to the System V versions should have no backwards-compatibility ramifications.</p>

<p>On BSD-based systems, a <b>-u</b> <i>user</i> option has allowed those with appropriate privileges to access the work of other
users. Since this is primarily a system administration feature and is not universally implemented, it has been omitted. Similarly,
a specification for the output format for a user with appropriate privileges viewing the queues of other users has been
omitted.</p>

<p>The <b>-f</b> <i>file</i> option from System V is used instead of the BSD method of using the last operand as the pathname. The
BSD method is ambiguous-does:</p>

<pre>
<tt>at 1200 friday
</tt>
</pre>

<p>mean the same thing if there is a file named <b>friday</b> in the current directory?</p>

<p>The <i>at_job_id</i> is composed of a limited character set in historical practice, and it is mandated here to invalidate
systems that might try using characters that require shell quoting or that could not be easily parsed by shell scripts.</p>

<p>The <i>at</i> utility varies between System V and BSD systems in the way timezones are used. On System V systems, the <i>TZ</i>
variable affects the at-job submission times and the times displayed for the user. On BSD systems, <i>TZ</i> is not taken into
account. The BSD behavior is easily achieved with the current specification. If the user wishes to have the timezone default to
that of the system, they merely need to issue the <i>at</i> command immediately following an unsetting or null assignment to <i>TZ
.</i> For example:</p>

<pre>

<p>gives the desired BSD result.</p>

<p>While the <a href="../utilities/yacc.html"><i>yacc</i></a>-like grammar specified in the OPERANDS section is lexically
unambiguous with respect to the digit strings, a lexical analyzer would probably be written to look for and return digit strings in
those cases. The parser could then check whether the digit string returned is a valid <i>day_number</i>, <i>year_number</i>, and so
on, based on the context.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First released in Issue 2.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_20_05_22"></a>Issue 6</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>This utility is marked as part of the User Portability Utilities option.</p>

<p>The following new requirements on POSIX implementations derive from alignment with the Single UNIX Specification:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If <b>-m</b> is not used, the job's standard output and standard error are provided to the user by mail.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The effects of using the <b>-q</b> and <b>-t</b> options as defined in the IEEE&nbsp;P1003.2b draft standard are specified.</p>

<p>The normative text is reworded to avoid use of the term &quot;must&quot; for application requirements.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_20_05_23"></a>Issue 7</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The <i>at</i> utility is moved from the User Portability Utilities option to the Base. User Portability Utilities is now an
option for interactive utilities.</p>

<p>SD5-XCU-ERN-95 is applied, removing the references to fixed locations for the files referenced by the <i>at</i> utility.</p>

<p>SD5-XCU-ERN-97 is applied, updating the SYNOPSIS.</p>
