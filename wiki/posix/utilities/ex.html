<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_20_40_02"></a>SYNOPSIS</h4>

<blockquote class="synopsis">
<div class="box"><code><tt><sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('UP')">UP</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt=
"[Option Start]" border="0"> ex</tt> <b>[</b><tt>-rR</tt><b>] [</b><tt>-s|-v</tt><b>] [</b><tt>-c</tt> <i>command</i><b>]

</blockquote>

<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_20_40_03"></a>DESCRIPTION</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The <i>ex</i> utility is a line-oriented text editor. There are two other modes of the editor-open and visual-in which
screen-oriented editing is available. This is described more fully by the <i>ex</i> <b>open</b> and <b>visual</b> commands and in
<a href="../utilities/vi.html#"><i>vi</i></a>.</p>

<p>If an operand is <tt>'-'</tt>, the results are unspecified.</p>

<p>This section uses the term <i>edit buffer</i> to describe the current working text. No specific implementation is implied by
this term. All editing changes are performed on the edit buffer, and no changes to it shall affect any file until an editor command
writes the file.</p>

<p>Certain terminals do not have all the capabilities necessary to support the complete <i>ex</i> definition, such as the
full-screen editing commands (<i>visual mode</i> or <i>open mode</i>). When these commands cannot be supported on such terminals,
this condition shall not produce an error message such as &quot;not an editor command&quot; or report a syntax error. The implementation
may either accept the commands and produce results on the screen that are the result of an unsuccessful attempt to meet the
requirements of this volume of POSIX.1-2017 or report an error describing the terminal-related deficiency.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_20_40_04"></a>OPTIONS</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The <i>ex</i> utility shall conform to XBD <a href="../basedefs/V1_chap12.html#tag_12_02"><i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i></a>,
except for the unspecified usage of <tt>'-'</tt>, and that <tt>'+'</tt> may be recognized as an option delimiter as well as
<tt>'-'</tt>.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<dl compact>
<dt><b>-c&nbsp;</b> <i>command</i></dt>

<dd>Specify an initial command to be executed in the first edit buffer loaded from an existing file (see the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
section). Implementations may support more than a single <b>-c</b> option. In such implementations, the specified commands shall be
executed in the order specified on the command line.</dd>

<dt><b>-r</b></dt>

<dd>Recover the named files (see the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section). Recovery information for a file shall be saved during an editor
or system crash (for example, when the editor is terminated by a signal which the editor can catch), or after the use of an
<i>ex</i> <b>preserve</b> command. 

<p>A <i>crash</i> in this context is an unexpected failure of the system or utility that requires restarting the failed system or
utility. A system crash implies that any utilities running at the time also crash. In the case of an editor or system crash, the
number of changes to the edit buffer (since the most recent <b>preserve</b> command) that will be recovered is unspecified.</p>

<p>If no <i>file</i> operands are given and the <b>-t</b> option is not specified, all other options, the <i>EXINIT</i> variable,
and any <b>.exrc</b> files shall be ignored; a list of all recoverable files available to the invoking user shall be written, and
the editor shall exit normally without further action.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>-R</b></dt>

<dd>Set <b>readonly</b> edit option.</dd>

<dt><b>-s</b></dt>

<dd>Prepare <i>ex</i> for batch use by taking the following actions: 

<ul>
<li>
<p>Suppress writing prompts and informational (but not diagnostic) messages.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Ignore the value of <i>TERM</i> and any implementation default terminal type and assume the terminal is a type incapable of
supporting open or visual modes; see the <b>visual</b> command and the description of <a href="../utilities/vi.html#"><i>vi</i></a>
.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Suppress the use of the <i>EXINIT</i> environment variable and the reading of any <b>.exrc</b> file; see the EXTENDED
DESCRIPTION section.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Suppress autoindentation, ignoring the value of the <b>autoindent</b> edit option.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><b>-t&nbsp;</b> <i>tagstring</i></dt>

<dd>Edit the file containing the specified <i>tagstring</i>; see <a href="../utilities/ctags.html#"><i>ctags</i></a>. The tags
feature represented by <b>-t</b> <i>tagstring</i> and the <b>tag</b> command is optional. It shall be provided on any system that
also provides a conforming implementation of <a href="../utilities/ctags.html"><i>ctags</i></a>; otherwise, the use of <b>-t</b>
produces undefined results. On any system, it shall be an error to specify more than a single <b>-t</b> option.</dd>

<dt><b>-v</b></dt>

<dd>Begin in visual mode (see <a href="../utilities/vi.html#"><i>vi</i></a>).</dd>

<dt><b>-w&nbsp;</b> <i>size</i></dt>

<dd>Set the value of the <i>window</i> editor option to <i>size</i>.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>

<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_20_40_05"></a>OPERANDS</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<dl compact>
<dt><i>file</i></dt>

<dd>A pathname of a file to be edited.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>

<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_20_40_06"></a>STDIN</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The standard input consists of a series of commands and input text, as described in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section. The
implementation may limit each line of standard input to a length of {LINE_MAX}.</p>

<p>If the standard input is not a terminal device, it shall be as if the <b>-s</b> option had been specified.</p>

<p>If a read from the standard input returns an error, or if the editor detects an end-of-file condition from the standard input,
it shall be equivalent to a SIGHUP asynchronous event.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_20_40_07"></a>INPUT FILES</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Input files shall be text files or files that would be text files except for an incomplete last line that is not longer than
{LINE_MAX}-1 bytes in length and contains no NUL characters. By default, any incomplete last line shall be treated as if it had a
trailing &lt;newline&gt;. The editing of other forms of files may optionally be allowed by <i>ex</i> implementations.</p>

<p>The <b>.exrc</b> files and source files shall be text files consisting of <i>ex</i> commands; see the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
section.</p>

<p>By default, the editor shall read lines from the files to be edited without interpreting any of those lines as any form of
editor command.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_20_40_08"></a>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <i>ex</i>:</p>

<dl compact>
<dt><i>COLUMNS</i></dt>

<dd>Override the system-selected horizontal screen size. See XBD <a href="../basedefs/V1_chap08.html#tag_08"><i>Environment
Variables</i></a> for valid values and results when it is unset or null.</dd>

DESCRIPTION section.</dd>

<dt><i>LANG</i></dt>

<dd>Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See XBD <a href=
"../basedefs/V1_chap08.html#tag_08_02"><i>Internationalization Variables</i></a> for the precedence of internationalization

<dt><i>LC_ALL</i></dt>

<dd>If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization variables.</dd>

<dt><i>LC_COLLATE</i></dt>

<dd>
Determine the locale for the behavior of ranges, equivalence classes, and multi-character collating elements within regular
expressions.</dd>

<dt><i>LC_CTYPE</i></dt>

<dd>Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as
opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input files), the behavior of character classes within regular expressions, the
classification of characters as uppercase or lowercase letters, the case conversion of letters, and the detection of word
boundaries.</dd>

<dt><i>LC_MESSAGES</i></dt>

<dd>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.</dd>

<dt><i>LINES</i></dt>

<dd>Override the system-selected vertical screen size, used as the number of lines in a screenful and the vertical screen size in
visual mode. See XBD <a href="../basedefs/V1_chap08.html#tag_08"><i>Environment Variables</i></a> for valid values and results when
it is unset or null.</dd>

<dt><i>NLSPATH</i></dt>

<dd><sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('XSI')">XSI</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0">

"../utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_09_01_01"><i>Command Search and Execution</i></a>.</dd>

<dt><i>SHELL</i></dt>

<dd>Determine the preferred command line interpreter for use as the default value of the <b>shell</b> edit option.</dd>

<dt><i>TERM</i></dt>

<dd>Determine the name of the terminal type. If this variable is unset or null, an unspecified default terminal type shall be
used.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>

<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_20_40_09"></a>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The following term is used in this and following sections to specify command and asynchronous event actions:</p>

<dl compact>
<dt><i>complete&nbsp;write</i></dt>

<dd>
A complete write is a write of the entire contents of the edit buffer to a file of a type other than a terminal device, or the
saving of the edit buffer caused by the user executing the <i>ex</i> <b>preserve</b> command. Writing the contents of the edit
buffer to a temporary file that will be removed when the editor exits shall not be considered a complete write.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The following actions shall be taken upon receipt of signals:</p>

<dl compact>
<dt>SIGINT</dt>

<dd>If the standard input is not a terminal device, <i>ex</i> shall not write the file or return to command or text input mode, and
shall exit with a non-zero exit status. 

<p>Otherwise, if executing an open or visual text input mode command, <i>ex</i> in receipt of SIGINT shall behave identically to
its receipt of the &lt;ESC&gt; character.</p>

<p>Otherwise:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>If executing an <i>ex</i> text input mode command, all input lines that have been completely entered shall be resolved into the
edit buffer, and any partially entered line shall be discarded.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If there is a currently executing command, it shall be aborted and a message displayed. Unless otherwise specified by the
<i>ex</i> or <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> command descriptions, it is unspecified whether any lines modified by the
executing command appear modified, or as they were before being modified by the executing command, in the buffer.</p>

<p>If the currently executing command was a motion command, its associated command shall be discarded.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If in open or visual command mode, the terminal shall be alerted.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The editor shall then return to command mode.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</dd>

<dt>SIGCONT</dt>

<dd>The screen shall be refreshed if in open or visual mode.</dd>

<dt>SIGHUP</dt>

<dd>If the edit buffer has been modified since the last complete write, <i>ex</i> shall attempt to save the edit buffer so that it
can be recovered later using the <b>-r</b> option or the <i>ex</i> <b>recover</b> command. The editor shall not write the file or
return to command or text input mode, and shall terminate with a non-zero exit status.</dd>

<dt>SIGTERM</dt>

<dd>Refer to SIGHUP.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The action taken for all other signals is unspecified.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_20_40_10"></a>STDOUT</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The standard output shall be used only for writing prompts to the user, for informational messages, and for writing lines from
the file.</p>

<p>The output from <i>ex</i> shall be text files.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_20_40_13"></a>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Only the <i>ex</i> mode of the editor is described in this section. See <a href="../utilities/vi.html#"><i>vi</i></a> for
additional editing capabilities available in <i>ex</i>.</p>

<p>When an error occurs, <i>ex</i> shall write a message. If the terminal supports a standout mode (such as inverse video), the
message shall be written in standout mode. If the terminal does not support a standout mode, and the edit option <b>errorbells</b>
is set, an alert action shall precede the error message.</p>

<p>By default, <i>ex</i> shall start in command mode, which shall be indicated by a <b>:</b> prompt; see the <b>prompt</b> command.
Text input mode can be entered by the <b>append</b>, <b>insert</b>, or <b>change</b> commands; it can be exited (and command mode
re-entered) by typing a &lt;period&gt; ( <tt>'.'</tt> ) alone at the beginning of a line.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_13_01"></a>Initialization in ex and vi</h5>

<p>The following symbols are used in this and following sections to specify locations in the edit buffer:</p>

<dl compact>
<dt><i>alternate&nbsp;and&nbsp;current&nbsp;pathnames</i></dt>

<dd>
Two pathnames, named <i>current</i> and <i>alternate</i>, are maintained by the editor. Any <i>ex</i> commands that take filenames
as arguments shall set them as follows: 

<ol>
<li>
<p>If a <i>file</i> argument is specified to the <i>ex</i> <b>edit</b>, <b>ex</b>, or <b>recover</b> commands, or if an <i>ex</i>
<b>tag</b> command replaces the contents of the edit buffer.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If the command replaces the contents of the edit buffer, the current pathname shall be set to the <i>file</i> argument or the
file indicated by the tag, and the alternate pathname shall be set to the previous value of the current pathname.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Otherwise, the alternate pathname shall be set to the <i>file</i> argument.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>
<p>If a <i>file</i> argument is specified to the <i>ex</i> <b>next</b> command:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If the command replaces the contents of the edit buffer, the current pathname shall be set to the first <i>file</i> argument,
and the alternate pathname shall be set to the previous value of the current pathname.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>
<p>If a <i>file</i> argument is specified to the <i>ex</i> <b>file</b> command, the current pathname shall be set to the
<i>file</i> argument, and the alternate pathname shall be set to the previous value of the current pathname.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If a <i>file</i> argument is specified to the <i>ex</i> <b>read</b> and <b>write</b> commands (that is, when reading or writing
a file, and not to the program named by the <b>shell</b> edit option), or a <i>file</i> argument is specified to the <i>ex</i>
<b>xit</b> command:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If the current pathname has no value, the current pathname shall be set to the <i>file</i> argument.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Otherwise, the alternate pathname shall be set to the <i>file</i> argument.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<p>If the alternate pathname is set to the previous value of the current pathname when the current pathname had no previous value,
then the alternate pathname shall have no value as a result.</p>
</dd>

<dt><i>current&nbsp;line</i></dt>

<dd>
The line of the edit buffer referenced by the cursor. Each command description specifies the current line after the command has
been executed, as the <i>current line value</i>. When the edit buffer contains no lines, the current line shall be zero; see <a
href="#tag_20_40_13_02">Addressing in ex</a>.</dd>

<dt><i>current&nbsp;column</i></dt>

<dd>
The current display line column occupied by the cursor. (The columns shall be numbered beginning at 1.) Each command description
specifies the current column after the command has been executed, as the <i>current column</i> value. This column is an
<i>ideal</i> column that is remembered over the lifetime of the editor. The actual display line column upon which the cursor rests
may be different from the current column; see the cursor positioning discussion in <a href=
"../utilities/vi.html#tag_20_152_13_02"><i>Command Descriptions in vi</i></a>.</dd>

<dt><i>set&nbsp;to&nbsp;non-&lt;blank&gt;</i></dt>

<dd>
A description for a current column value, meaning that the current column shall be set to the last display line column on which is
displayed any part of the first non- &lt;blank&gt; of the line. If the line has no non- &lt;blank&gt; non- &lt;newline&gt;
characters, the current column shall be set to the last display line column on which is displayed any part of the last non-
&lt;newline&gt; character in the line. If the line is empty, the current column shall be set to column position 1.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The length of lines in the edit buffer may be limited to {LINE_MAX} bytes. In open and visual mode, the length of lines in the
edit buffer may be limited to the number of characters that will fit in the display. If either limit is exceeded during editing, an
error message shall be written. If either limit is exceeded by a line read in from a file, an error message shall be written and
the edit session may be terminated.</p>

<p>If the editor stops running due to any reason other than a user command, and the edit buffer has been modified since the last
complete write, it shall be equivalent to a SIGHUP asynchronous event. If the system crashes, it shall be equivalent to a SIGHUP
asynchronous event.</p>

<p>During initialization (before the first file is copied into the edit buffer or any user commands from the terminal are
processed) the following shall occur:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>If the environment variable <i>EXINIT</i> is set, the editor shall execute the <i>ex</i> commands contained in that
variable.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If the <i>EXINIT</i> variable is not set, and all of the following are true:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The <i>HOME</i> environment variable is not null and not empty.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The file <b>.exrc</b> in the directory referred to by the <i>HOME</i> environment variable:</p>

<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Exists</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Is owned by the same user ID as the real user ID of the process or the process has appropriate privileges</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Is not writable by anyone other than the owner</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<p>the editor shall execute the <i>ex</i> commands contained in that file.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If and only if all of the following are true:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The current directory is not referred to by the <i>HOME</i> environment variable.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A command in the <i>EXINIT</i> environment variable or a command in the <b>.exrc</b> file in the directory referred to by the
<i>HOME</i> environment variable sets the editor option <b>exrc</b>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The <b>.exrc</b> file in the current directory:</p>

<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Exists</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Is owned by the same user ID as the real user ID of the process, or by one of a set of implementation-defined user IDs</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Is not writable by anyone other than the owner</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<p>the editor shall attempt to execute the <i>ex</i> commands contained in that file.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Lines in any <b>.exrc</b> file that are blank lines shall be ignored. If any <b>.exrc</b> file exists, but is not read for
ownership or permission reasons, it shall be an error.</p>

<p>After the <i>EXINIT</i> variable and any <b>.exrc</b> files are processed, the first file specified by the user shall be edited,
as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>If the user specified the <b>-t</b> option, the effect shall be as if the <i>ex</i> <b>tag</b> command was entered with the
specified argument, with the exception that if tag processing does not result in a file to edit, the effect shall be as described
in step 3. below.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Otherwise, if the user specified any command line <i>file</i> arguments, the effect shall be as if the <i>ex</i> <b>edit</b>
command was entered with the first of those arguments as its <i>file</i> argument.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Otherwise, the effect shall be as if the <i>ex</i> <b>edit</b> command was entered with a nonexistent filename as its
<i>file</i> argument. It is unspecified whether this action shall set the current pathname. In an implementation where this action
does not set the current pathname, any editor command using the current pathname shall fail until an editor command sets the
current pathname.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>If the <b>-r</b> option was specified, the first time a file in the initial argument list or a file specified by the <b>-t</b>
option is edited, if recovery information has previously been saved about it, that information shall be recovered and the editor
shall behave as if the contents of the edit buffer have already been modified. If there are multiple instances of the file to be
recovered, the one most recently saved shall be recovered, and an informational message that there are previous versions of the
file that can be recovered shall be written. If no recovery information about a file is available, an informational message to this
effect shall be written, and the edit shall proceed as usual.</p>

<p>If the <b>-c</b> option was specified, the first time a file that already exists (including a file that might not exist but for
which recovery information is available, when the <b>-r</b> option is specified) replaces or initializes the contents of the edit
buffer, the current line shall be set to the last line of the edit buffer, the current column shall be set to non- &lt;blank&gt;,
and the <i>ex</i> commands specified with the <b>-c</b> option shall be executed. In this case, the current line and current column
shall not be set as described for the command associated with the replacement or initialization of the edit buffer contents.
However, if the <b>-t</b> option or a <b>tag</b> command is associated with this action, the <b>-c</b> option commands shall be
executed and then the movement to the tag shall be performed.</p>

<p>The current argument list shall initially be set to the filenames specified by the user on the command line. If no filenames are
specified by the user, the current argument list shall be empty. If the <b>-t</b> option was specified, it is unspecified whether
any filename resulting from tag processing shall be prepended to the current argument list. In the case where the filename is added
as a prefix to the current argument list, the current argument list reference shall be set to that filename. In the case where the
filename is not added as a prefix to the current argument list, the current argument list reference shall logically be located
before the first of the filenames specified on the command line (for example, a subsequent <i>ex</i> <b>next</b> command shall edit
the first filename from the command line). If the <b>-t</b> option was not specified, the current argument list reference shall be
to the first of the filenames on the command line.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_13_02"></a>Addressing in ex</h5>

<p>Addressing in <i>ex</i> relates to the current line and the current column; the address of a line is its 1-based line number,
the address of a column is its 1-based count from the beginning of the line. Generally, the current line is the last line affected
by a command. The current line number is the address of the current line. In each command description, the effect of the command on
the current line number and the current column is described.</p>

<p>Addresses are constructed as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The character <tt>'.'</tt> (period) shall address the current line.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The character <tt>'$'</tt> shall address the last line of the edit buffer.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The positive decimal number <i>n</i> shall address the <i>n</i>th line of the edit buffer.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The address <tt>"'x"</tt> refers to the line marked with the mark name character <tt>'x'</tt>, which shall be a lowercase
letter from the portable character set, the backquote character, or the single-quote character. It shall be an error if the line
that was marked is not currently present in the edit buffer or the mark has not been set. Lines can be marked with the <i>ex</i>
<b>mark</b> or <b>k</b> commands, or the <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> <b>m</b> command.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A regular expression enclosed by &lt;slash&gt; characters ( <tt>'/'</tt> ) shall address the first line found by searching
forwards from the line following the current line toward the end of the edit buffer and stopping at the first line for which the
line excluding the terminating &lt;newline&gt; matches the regular expression. As stated in <a href="#tag_20_40_13_58">Regular
Expressions in ex</a>, an address consisting of a null regular expression delimited by &lt;slash&gt; characters ( <tt>"//"</tt> )
shall address the next line for which the line excluding the terminating &lt;newline&gt; matches the last regular expression
encountered. In addition, the second &lt;slash&gt; can be omitted at the end of a command line. If the <b>wrapscan</b> edit option
is set, the search shall wrap around to the beginning of the edit buffer and continue up to and including the current line, so that
the entire edit buffer is searched. Within the regular expression, the sequence <tt>"\/"</tt> shall represent a literal
&lt;slash&gt; instead of the regular expression delimiter.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A regular expression enclosed in &lt;question-mark&gt; characters ( <tt>'?'</tt> ) shall address the first line found by
searching backwards from the line preceding the current line toward the beginning of the edit buffer and stopping at the first line
for which the line excluding the terminating &lt;newline&gt; matches the regular expression. An address consisting of a null
regular expression delimited by &lt;question-mark&gt; characters ( <tt>"??"</tt> ) shall address the previous line for which the
line excluding the terminating &lt;newline&gt; matches the last regular expression encountered. In addition, the second
&lt;question-mark&gt; can be omitted at the end of a command line. If the <b>wrapscan</b> edit option is set, the search shall wrap
around from the beginning of the edit buffer to the end of the edit buffer and continue up to and including the current line, so
that the entire edit buffer is searched. Within the regular expression, the sequence <tt>"\?"</tt> shall represent a literal
&lt;question-mark&gt; instead of the RE delimiter.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A &lt;plus-sign&gt; ( <tt>'+'</tt> ) or a &lt;hyphen-minus&gt; ( <tt>'-'</tt> ) followed by a decimal number shall address the
current line plus or minus the number. A <tt>'+'</tt> or <tt>'-'</tt> not followed by a decimal number shall address the current
line plus or minus 1.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Addresses can be followed by zero or more address offsets, optionally &lt;blank&gt;-separated. Address offsets are constructed
as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>A <tt>'+'</tt> or <tt>'-'</tt> immediately followed by a decimal number shall add (subtract) the indicated number of lines to
(from) the address. A <tt>'+'</tt> or <tt>'-'</tt> not followed by a decimal number shall add (subtract) 1 to (from) the
address.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A decimal number shall add the indicated number of lines to the address.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>It shall not be an error for an intermediate address value to be less than zero or greater than the last line in the edit
buffer. It shall be an error for the final address value to be less than zero or greater than the last line in the edit buffer.</p>

<p>Commands take zero, one, or two addresses; see the descriptions of <i>1addr</i> and <i>2addr</i> in <a href=
"#tag_20_40_13_10">Command Descriptions in ex</a>. If more than the required number of addresses are provided to a command that
requires zero addresses, it shall be an error. Otherwise, if more than the required number of addresses are provided to a command,
the addresses specified first shall be evaluated and then discarded until the maximum number of valid addresses remain.</p>

<p>Addresses shall be separated from each other by a &lt;comma&gt; ( <tt>','</tt> ) or a &lt;semicolon&gt; ( <tt>';'</tt> ). If no
address is specified before or after a &lt;comma&gt; or &lt;semicolon&gt; separator, it shall be as if the address of the current
line was specified before or after the separator. In the case of a &lt;semicolon&gt; separator, the current line ( <tt>'.'</tt> )
shall be set to the first address, and only then will the next address be calculated. This feature can be used to determine the
starting line for forwards and backwards searches (see rules 5. and 6.).</p>

<p>A &lt;percent-sign&gt; ( <tt>'%'</tt> ) shall be equivalent to entering the two addresses <tt>"1,$"</tt>.</p>

<p>Any delimiting &lt;blank&gt; characters between addresses, address separators, or address offsets shall be discarded.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_13_03"></a>Command Line Parsing in ex</h5>

<p>The following symbol is used in this and following sections to describe parsing behavior:</p>

<dl compact>
<dt><i>escape</i></dt>

<dd>If a character is referred to as &quot; &lt;backslash&gt;-escaped&quot; or &quot; &lt;control&gt;-V-escaped&quot;, it shall mean that the
character acquired or lost a special meaning by virtue of being preceded, respectively, by a &lt;backslash&gt; or &lt;control&gt;-V
character. Unless otherwise specified, the escaping character shall be discarded at that time and shall not be further considered
for any purpose.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Command-line parsing shall be done in the following steps. For each step, characters already evaluated shall be ignored; that
is, the phrase &quot;leading character&quot; refers to the next character that has not yet been evaluated.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Leading &lt;colon&gt; characters shall be skipped.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Leading &lt;blank&gt; characters shall be skipped.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If the leading character is a double-quote character, the characters up to and including the next non- &lt;backslash&gt;-escaped
&lt;newline&gt; shall be discarded, and any subsequent characters shall be parsed as a separate command.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Leading characters that can be interpreted as addresses shall be evaluated; see <a href="#tag_20_40_13_02">Addressing in ex</a>
.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Leading &lt;blank&gt; characters shall be skipped.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If the next character is a &lt;vertical-line&gt; character or a &lt;newline&gt;:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If the next character is a &lt;newline&gt;:</p>

<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>If <i>ex</i> is in open or visual mode, the current line shall be set to the last address specified, if any.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Otherwise, if the last command was terminated by a &lt;vertical-line&gt; character, no action shall be taken; for example, the
command <tt>"||&lt;newline&gt;"</tt> shall execute two implied commands, not three.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Otherwise, step 6.b. shall apply.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>
<p>Otherwise, the implied command shall be the <b>print</b> command. The last <b>#</b>, <b>p</b>, and <b>l</b> flags specified to
any <i>ex</i> command shall be remembered and shall apply to this implied command. Executing the <i>ex</i> <b>number</b>,
<b>print</b>, or <b>list</b> command shall set the remembered flags to <b>#</b>, nothing, and <b>l</b>, respectively, plus any
other flags specified for that execution of the <b>number</b>, <b>print</b>, or <b>list</b> command.</p>

<p>If <i>ex</i> is not currently performing a <b>global</b> or <b>v</b> command, and no address or count is specified, the current
line shall be incremented by 1 before the command is executed. If incrementing the current line would result in an address past the
last line in the edit buffer, the command shall fail, and the increment shall not happen.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The &lt;newline&gt; or &lt;vertical-line&gt; character shall be discarded and any subsequent characters shall be parsed as a
separate command.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>
<p>The command name shall be comprised of the next character (if the character is not alphabetic), or the next character and any
subsequent alphabetic characters (if the character is alphabetic), with the following exceptions:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Commands that consist of any prefix of the characters in the command name <b>delete</b>, followed immediately by any of the
characters <tt>'l'</tt>, <tt>'p'</tt>, <tt>'+'</tt>, <tt>'-'</tt>, or <tt>'#'</tt> shall be interpreted as a <b>delete</b>
command, followed by a &lt;blank&gt;, followed by the characters that were not part of the prefix of the <b>delete</b> command. The
maximum number of characters shall be matched to the command name <b>delete</b>; for example, <tt>"del"</tt> shall not be treated
as <tt>"de"</tt> followed by the flag <b>l</b>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Commands that consist of the character <tt>'k'</tt>, followed by a character that can be used as the name of a mark, shall be
equivalent to the mark command followed by a &lt;blank&gt;, followed by the character that followed the <tt>'k'</tt>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Commands that consist of the character <tt>'s'</tt>, followed by characters that could be interpreted as valid options to the

</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>
<p>The command name shall be matched against the possible command names, and a command name that contains a prefix matching the

<p>Command arguments shall be parsed as described by the Synopsis and Description of each individual <i>ex</i> command. This
parsing shall not be &lt;blank&gt;-sensitive, except for the <b>!</b> argument, which must follow the command name without
intervening &lt;blank&gt; characters, and where it would otherwise be ambiguous. For example, <i>count</i> and <i>flag</i>

special meaning as shell expansion characters or <tt>'!'</tt>, <tt>'%'</tt>, and <tt>'#'</tt> expansion characters. See <a href=
"#tag_20_40_13_58">Regular Expressions in ex</a> and <a href="#tag_20_40_13_59">Replacement Strings in ex</a> for descriptions of

<p>If the <i>ex</i> command resulted from a map expansion, all characters from that map expansion shall be discarded, except as
otherwise specified by the <b>map</b> command.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_13_10"></a>Command Descriptions in ex</h5>

<p>The following symbols are used in this section to represent command modifiers. Some of these modifiers can be omitted, in which
case the specified defaults shall be used.</p>

<dl compact>
<dt><i>1addr</i></dt>

<dd>A single line address, given in any of the forms described in <a href="#tag_20_40_13_02">Addressing in ex</a>; the default
shall be the current line ( <tt>'.'</tt> ), unless otherwise specified. 

<p>If the line address is zero, it shall be an error, unless otherwise specified in the following command descriptions.</p>

<p>If the edit buffer is empty, and the address is specified with a command other than <b>=</b>, <b>append</b>, <b>insert</b>,
<b>open</b>, <b>put</b>, <b>read</b>, or <b>visual</b>, or the address is not zero, it shall be an error.</p>
</dd>

<dt><i>2addr</i></dt>

<dd>Two addresses specifying an inclusive range of lines. If no addresses are specified, the default for <i>2addr</i> shall be the
current line only ( <tt>".,."</tt> ), unless otherwise specified in the following command descriptions. If one address is
specified, <i>2addr</i> shall specify that line only, unless otherwise specified in the following command descriptions. 

<p>It shall be an error if the first address is greater than the second address.</p>

<p>If the edit buffer is empty, and the two addresses are specified with a command other than the <b>!</b>, <b>write</b>,
<b>wq</b>, or <b>xit</b> commands, or either address is not zero, it shall be an error.</p>
</dd>

<dt><i>count</i></dt>

<dd>A positive decimal number. If <i>count</i> is specified, it shall be equivalent to specifying an additional address to the
command, unless otherwise specified by the following command descriptions. The additional address shall be equal to the last
address specified to the command (either explicitly or by default) plus <i>count</i>-1. 

<p>If this would result in an address greater than the last line of the edit buffer, it shall be corrected to equal the last line
of the edit buffer.</p>
</dd>

<dt><i>flags</i></dt>

<dd>One or more of the characters <tt>'+'</tt>, <tt>'-'</tt>, <tt>'#'</tt>, <tt>'p'</tt>, or <tt>'l'</tt> (ell). The flag
characters can be &lt;blank&gt;-separated, and in any order or combination. The characters <tt>'#'</tt>, <tt>'p'</tt>, and
<tt>'l'</tt> shall cause lines to be written in the format specified by the <b>print</b> command with the specified <i>flags</i>. 

<p>The lines to be written are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>All edit buffer lines written during the execution of the <i>ex</i> <b>&amp;</b>, <b>&#152;</b>, <b>list</b>, <b>number</b>,
<b>open</b>, <b>print</b>, <b>s</b>, <b>visual</b>, and <b>z</b> commands shall be written as specified by <i>flags</i>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>After the completion of an <i>ex</i> command with a flag as an argument, the current line shall be written as specified by
<i>flags</i>, unless the current line was the last line written by the command.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The characters <tt>'+'</tt> and <tt>'-'</tt> cause the value of the current line after the execution of the <i>ex</i> command to
be adjusted by the offset address as described in <a href="#tag_20_40_13_02">Addressing in ex</a>. This adjustment shall occur
before the current line is written as described in 2. above.</p>

<p>The default for <i>flags</i> shall be none.</p>
</dd>

<dt><i>buffer</i></dt>

<dd>One of a number of named areas for holding text. The named buffers are specified by the alphanumeric characters of the POSIX
locale. There shall also be one &quot;unnamed&quot; buffer. When no buffer is specified for editor commands that use a buffer, the unnamed
buffer shall be used. Commands that store text into buffers shall store the text as it was before the command took effect, and
shall store text occurring earlier in the file before text occurring later in the file, regardless of how the text region was
specified. Commands that store text into buffers shall store the text into the unnamed buffer as well as any specified buffer. 

<p>In <i>ex</i> commands, buffer names are specified as the name by itself. In open or visual mode commands the name is preceded by
a double-quote ( <tt>' )'</tt> character.</p>

<p>If the specified buffer name is an uppercase character, and the buffer contents are to be modified, the buffer shall be appended
to rather than being overwritten. If the buffer is not being modified, specifying the buffer name in lowercase and uppercase shall
have identical results.</p>

<p>There shall also be buffers named by the numbers 1 through 9. In open and visual mode, if a region of text including characters
from more than a single line is being modified by the <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> <b>c</b> or <b>d</b> commands,
the motion character associated with the <b>c</b> or <b>d</b> commands specifies that the buffer text shall be in line mode, or the
commands <b>%</b>, <b>`</b>, <b>/</b>, <b>?</b>, <b>(</b>, <b>)</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>n</b>, <b>{</b>, or <b>}</b> are used to define a
region of text for the <b>c</b> or <b>d</b> commands, the contents of buffers 1 through 8 shall be moved into the buffer named by
the next numerically greater value, the contents of buffer 9 shall be discarded, and the region of text shall be copied into buffer
1. This shall be in addition to copying the text into a user-specified buffer or unnamed buffer, or both. Numeric buffers can be
specified as a source buffer for open and visual mode commands; however, specifying a numeric buffer as the write target of an open
or visual mode command shall have unspecified results.</p>

<p>The text of each buffer shall have the characteristic of being in either line or character mode. Appending text to a non-empty
buffer shall set the mode to match the characteristic of the text being appended. Appending text to a buffer shall cause the
creation of at least one additional line in the buffer. All text stored into buffers by <i>ex</i> commands shall be in line mode.
The <i>ex</i> commands that use buffers as the source of text specify individually how buffers of different modes are handled. Each
open or visual mode command that uses buffers for any purpose specifies individually the mode of the text stored into the buffer
and how buffers of different modes are handled.</p>
</dd>

<dt><i>file</i></dt>

<dd>Command text used to derive a pathname. The default shall be the current pathname, as defined previously, in which case, if no
current pathname has yet been established it shall be an error, except where specifically noted in the individual command
descriptions that follow. If the command text contains any of the characters <tt>'&#152;'</tt>, <tt>'{'</tt>, <tt>'['</tt>,
<tt>'*'</tt>, <tt>'?'</tt>, <tt>'$'</tt>, <tt>' ,'</tt> backquote, single-quote, and &lt;backslash&gt;, it shall be subjected to
the process of &quot;shell expansions&quot;, as described below; if more than a single pathname results and the command expects only one,
it shall be an error. 

<p>The process of shell expansions in the editor shall be done as follows. The <i>ex</i> utility shall pass two arguments to the
program named by the shell edit option; the first shall be <b>-c</b>, and the second shall be the string <tt>"echo"</tt> and the
command text as a single argument. The standard output and standard error of that command shall replace the command text.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>!</b></dt>

<dd>A character that can be appended to the command name to modify its operation, as detailed in the individual command
descriptions. With the exception of the <i>ex</i> <b>read</b>, <b>write</b>, and <b>!</b> commands, the <tt>'!'</tt> character
shall only act as a modifier if there are no &lt;blank&gt; characters between it and the command name.</dd>

<dt><i>remembered&nbsp;search&nbsp;direction</i></dt>

<dd>
The <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> commands <b>N</b> and <b>n</b> begin searching in a forwards or backwards
direction in the edit buffer based on a remembered search direction, which is initially unset, and is set by the <i>ex</i>
<b>global</b>, <b>v</b>, <b>s</b>, and <b>tag</b> commands, and the <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> <b>/</b> and

<p>If <i>lhs</i> and <i>rhs</i> are not specified, write the current list of abbreviations and do nothing more.</p>

<p>Implementations may restrict the set of characters accepted in <i>lhs</i> or <i>rhs</i>, except that printable characters and
&lt;blank&gt; characters shall not be restricted. Additional restrictions shall be implementation-defined.</p>

<p>In both <i>lhs</i> and <i>rhs</i>, any character may be escaped with a &lt;control&gt;-V, in which case the character shall not
be used to delimit <i>lhs</i> from <i>rhs</i>, and the escaping &lt;control&gt;-V shall be discarded.</p>

<p>In open and visual text input mode, if a non-word or &lt;ESC&gt; character that is not escaped by a &lt;control&gt;-V character
is entered after a word character, a check shall be made for a set of characters matching <i>lhs</i>, in the text input entered
during this command. If it is found, the effect shall be as if <i>rhs</i> was entered instead of <i>lhs</i>.</p>

<p>The set of characters that are checked is defined as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>If there are no characters inserted before the word and non-word or &lt;ESC&gt; characters that triggered the check, the set of
characters shall consist of the word character.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If the character inserted before the word and non-word or &lt;ESC&gt; characters that triggered the check is a word character,
the set of characters shall consist of the characters inserted immediately before the triggering characters that are word
characters, plus the triggering word character.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If the character inserted before the word and non-word or &lt;ESC&gt; characters that triggered the check is not a word
character, the set of characters shall consist of the characters that were inserted before the triggering characters that are
neither &lt;blank&gt; characters nor word characters, plus the triggering word character.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>It is unspecified whether the <i>lhs</i> argument entered for the <i>ex</i> <b>abbreviate</b> and <b>unabbreviate</b> commands
is replaced in this fashion. Regardless of whether or not the replacement occurs, the effect of the command shall be as if the
replacement had not occurred.</p>

<p>If <tt>'!'</tt> is specified, write the current list of text input mode maps.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Otherwise, write the current list of command mode maps.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Do nothing more.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Implementations may restrict the set of characters accepted in <i>lhs</i> or <i>rhs</i>, except that printable characters and
&lt;blank&gt; characters shall not be restricted. Additional restrictions shall be implementation-defined. In both <i>lhs</i> and
<i>rhs</i>, any character can be escaped with a &lt;control&gt;-V, in which case the character shall not be used to delimit
<i>lhs</i> from <i>rhs</i>, and the escaping &lt;control&gt;-V shall be discarded.</p>

<p>If the character <tt>'!'</tt> is appended to the <b>map</b> command name, the mapping shall be effective during open or visual
text input mode rather than <b>open</b> or <b>visual</b> command mode. This allows <i>lhs</i> to have two different <b>map</b>
definitions at the same time: one for command mode and one for text input mode.<br>
</p>

<p>For command mode mappings:</p>

<blockquote>When the <i>lhs</i> is entered as any part of a <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> command in open or visual
mode (but not as part of the arguments to the command), the action shall be as if the corresponding <i>rhs</i> had been entered. 

<p>If any character in the command, other than the first, is escaped using a &lt;control&gt;-V character, that character shall not
be part of a match to an <i>lhs</i>.</p>

<p>It is unspecified whether implementations shall support <b>map</b> commands where the <i>lhs</i> is more than a single character
in length, where the first character of the <i>lhs</i> is printable.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>If <i>lhs</i> contains more than one character and the first character is <tt>'#'</tt>, followed by a sequence of
digits corresponding to a numbered function key, then when this function key is typed it shall be mapped to <i>rhs</i>. Characters
other than digits following a <tt>'#'</tt> character also represent the function key named by the characters in the <i>lhs</i>
following the <tt>'#'</tt> and may be mapped to <i>rhs</i>. It is unspecified how function keys are named or what function keys are
supported.</blockquote>

<p>For text input mode mappings:</p>

<blockquote>When the <i>lhs</i> is entered as any part of text entered in open or visual text input modes, the action shall be as
if the corresponding <i>rhs</i> had been entered. 

<p>If any character in the input text is escaped using a &lt;control&gt;-V character, that character shall not be part of a match
to an <i>lhs</i>.</p>

<p>It is unspecified whether the <i>lhs</i> text entered for subsequent <b>map</b> or <b>unmap</b> commands is replaced with the
<i>rhs</i> text for the purposes of the screen display; regardless of whether or not the display appears as if the corresponding
<i>rhs</i> text was entered, the effect of the command shall be as if the <i>lhs</i> text was entered.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If only part of the <i>lhs</i> is entered, it is unspecified how long the editor will wait for additional, possibly matching
characters before treating the already entered characters as not matching the <i>lhs</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>rhs</i> characters shall themselves be subject to remapping, unless otherwise specified by the <b>remap</b> edit option,
except that if the characters in <i>lhs</i> occur as prefix characters in <i>rhs</i>, those characters shall not be remapped.</p>

<p>On block-mode terminals, the mapping need not occur immediately (for example, it may occur after the terminal transmits a group
of characters to the system), but it shall achieve the same results as if it occurred immediately.</p>

<p>Replace the first instance of the pattern <i>pattern</i> by the string <i>repl</i> on each specified line. (See <a href=
"#tag_20_40_13_58">Regular Expressions in ex</a> and <a href="#tag_20_40_13_59">Replacement Strings in ex</a>.) Any
non-alphabetic, non- &lt;blank&gt; delimiter other than &lt;backslash&gt;, <tt>'|'</tt>, &lt;newline&gt;, or double-quote can be
used instead of <tt>'/'</tt>. &lt;backslash&gt; characters can be used to escape delimiters, &lt;backslash&gt; characters, and
other special characters.</p>

<p>The trailing delimiter can be omitted from <i>pattern</i> or from <i>repl</i> at the end of the command line. If both
<i>pattern</i> and <i>repl</i> are not specified or are empty (for example, <tt>"//"</tt> ), the last <b>s</b> command shall be
repeated. If only <i>pattern</i> is not specified or is empty, the last regular expression used in the editor shall be used as the
pattern. If only <i>repl</i> is not specified or is empty, the pattern shall be replaced by nothing. If the entire replacement
pattern is <tt>'%'</tt>, the last replacement pattern to an <b>s</b> command shall be used.</p>

<p>Entering a &lt;carriage-return&gt; in <i>repl</i> (which requires an escaping &lt;backslash&gt; in <i>ex</i> mode and an
escaping &lt;control&gt;-V in open or <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> mode) shall split the line at that point,
creating a new line in the edit buffer. The &lt;carriage-return&gt; shall be discarded.</p>

<p>If <i>options</i> includes the letter <tt>'g'</tt> (<b>global</b>), all non-overlapping instances of the pattern in the line
shall be replaced.</p>

<p>If <i>options</i> includes the letter <tt>'c'</tt> (<b>confirm</b>), then before each substitution the line shall be written;
the written line shall reflect all previous substitutions. On the following line, &lt;space&gt; characters shall be written beneath
the characters from the line that are before the <i>pattern</i> to be replaced, and <tt>'^'</tt> characters written beneath the
characters included in the <i>pattern</i> to be replaced. The <i>ex</i> utility shall then wait for a response from the user. An
affirmative response shall cause the substitution to be done, while any other input shall not make the substitution. An affirmative
response shall consist of a line with the affirmative response (as defined by the current locale) at the beginning of the line.
This line shall be subject to editing in the same way as the <i>ex</i> command line.</p>

<p>If interrupted (see the ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS section), any modifications confirmed by the user shall be preserved in the edit
buffer after the interrupt.</p>

<p>If the remembered search direction is not set, the <b>s</b> command shall set it to forward.</p>

<p>In the second Synopsis, the <b>&amp;</b> command shall repeat the previous substitution, as if the <b>&amp;</b> command were
replaced by:</p>

<pre>
<tt>s/</tt><i>pattern</i><tt>/</tt><i>repl</i><tt>/
</tt>
</pre>

<p>where <i>pattern</i> and <i>repl</i> are as specified in the previous <b>s</b>, <b>&amp;</b>, or <b>&#152;</b> command.</p>

<p>In the third Synopsis, the <b>&#152;</b> command shall repeat the previous substitution, as if the <tt>'&#152;'</tt> were
replaced by:</p>

<pre>
<tt>s/</tt><i>pattern</i><tt>/</tt><i>repl</i><tt>/

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_13_58"></a>Regular Expressions in ex</h5>

<p>The <i>ex</i> utility shall support regular expressions that are a superset of the basic regular expressions described in XBD <a
href="../basedefs/V1_chap09.html#tag_09_03"><i>Basic Regular Expressions</i></a>. A null regular expression ( <tt>"//"</tt> )
shall be equivalent to the last regular expression encountered.</p>

<p>Regular expressions can be used in addresses to specify lines and, in some commands (for example, the <b>substitute</b>
command), to specify portions of a line to be substituted.</p>

<p>The following constructs can be used to enhance the basic regular expressions:</p>

<dl compact>
<dt><tt>\&lt;</tt></dt>

<dd>Match the beginning of a <i>word</i>. (See the definition of <i>word</i> at the beginning of <a href="#tag_20_40_13_10">Command
Descriptions in ex</a>.)</dd>

<dt><tt>\&gt;</tt></dt>

<dd>Match the end of a <i>word</i>.</dd>

<dt><tt>&#152;</tt></dt>

<dd>Match the replacement part of the last <b>substitute</b> command. The &lt;tilde&gt; ( <tt>'&#152;'</tt> ) character can be
escaped in a regular expression to become a normal character with no special meaning. The &lt;backslash&gt; shall be
discarded.</dd>
</dl>

<p>When the editor option <b>magic</b> is not set, the only characters with special meanings shall be <tt>'^'</tt> at the beginning
of a pattern, <tt>'$'</tt> at the end of a pattern, and &lt;backslash&gt;. The characters <tt>'.'</tt>, <tt>'*'</tt>,
<tt>'['</tt>, and <tt>'&#152;'</tt> shall be treated as ordinary characters unless preceded by a &lt;backslash&gt;; when preceded
by a &lt;backslash&gt; they shall regain their special meaning, or in the case of &lt;backslash&gt;, be handled as a single
&lt;backslash&gt;. &lt;backslash&gt; characters used to escape other characters shall be discarded.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_13_59"></a>Replacement Strings in ex</h5>

<p>The character <tt>'&amp;'</tt> ( <tt>'\&amp;'</tt> if the editor option <b>magic</b> is not set) in the replacement string shall
stand for the text matched by the pattern to be replaced. The character <tt>'&#152;'</tt> ( <tt>'\&#152;'</tt> if <b>magic</b> is
not set) shall be replaced by the replacement part of the previous <b>substitute</b> command. The sequence <tt>'\n'</tt>, where
<i>n</i> is an integer, shall be replaced by the text matched by the corresponding back-reference expression. If the corresponding
back-reference expression does not match, then the characters <tt>'\n'</tt> shall be replaced by the empty string.</p>

<p>The strings <tt>'\l'</tt>, <tt>'\u'</tt>, <tt>'\L'</tt>, and <tt>'\U'</tt> can be used to modify the case of elements in the
replacement string (using the <tt>'\&amp;'</tt> or <tt>"\"</tt> digit) notation. The string <tt>'\l'</tt> ( <tt>'\u'</tt> ) shall
cause the character that follows to be converted to lowercase (uppercase). The string <tt>'\L'</tt> ( <tt>'\U'</tt> ) shall cause
all characters subsequent to it to be converted to lowercase (uppercase) as they are inserted by the substitution until the string
<tt>'\e'</tt> or <tt>'\E'</tt>, or the end of the replacement string, is encountered.</p>

<p>Otherwise, any character following a &lt;backslash&gt; shall be treated as that literal character, and the escaping
&lt;backslash&gt; shall be discarded.</p>

<p>An example of case conversion with the <b>s</b> command is as follows:</p>

<pre>
<b>:</b><tt>p
</tt><b>The cat sat on the mat.
:</b><tt>s/\&lt;.at\&gt;/\u&amp;/gp
</tt><b>The Cat Sat on the Mat.
:</b><tt>s/S\(.*\)M/S\U\1\eM/p
</tt><b>The Cat SAT ON THE Mat.</b>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_13_60"></a>Edit Options in ex</h5>

<p>The <i>ex</i> utility has a number of options that modify its behavior. These options have default settings, which can be
changed using the <b>set</b> command.</p>

<p>Options are Boolean unless otherwise specified.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_13_61"></a>autoindent, ai</h5>

<p>[Default <i>unset</i>]</p>

<p>If <b>autoindent</b> is set, each line in input mode shall be indented (using first as many &lt;tab&gt; characters as possible,

</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_13_62"></a>autoprint, ap</h5>

<p>[Default <i>set</i>]</p>

<p>If <b>autoprint</b> is set, the current line shall be written after each <i>ex</i> command that modifies the contents of the
current edit buffer, and after each <b>tag</b> command for which the tag search pattern was found or tag line number was valid,
unless:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The command was executed while in open or visual mode.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The command was executed as part of a <b>global</b> or <b>v</b> command or <b>@</b> buffer execution.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The command was the form of the <b>read</b> command that reads a file into the edit buffer.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The command was the <b>append</b>, <b>change</b>, or <b>insert</b> command.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The command was not terminated by a &lt;newline&gt;.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The current line shall be written by a flag specified to the command; for example, <b>delete #</b> shall write the current line
as specified for the flag modifier to the <b>delete</b> command, and not as specified by the <b>autoprint</b> edit option.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_13_63"></a>autowrite, aw</h5>

<p>[Default <i>unset</i>]</p>

<p>If <b>autowrite</b> is set, and the edit buffer has been modified since it was last completely written to any file, the contents
of the edit buffer shall be written as if the <i>ex</i> <b>write</b> command had been specified without arguments, before each
command affected by the <b>autowrite</b> edit option is executed. Appending the character <tt>'!'</tt> to the command name of any
of the <i>ex</i> commands except <tt>'!'</tt> shall prevent the write. If the write fails, it shall be an error and the command
shall not be executed.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_13_64"></a>beautify, bf</h5>

<p><sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('XSI')">XSI</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0">

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_13_65"></a>directory, dir</h5>

<p>[Default <i>implementation-defined</i>]</p>

<p>The value of this option specifies the directory in which the editor buffer is to be placed. If this directory is not writable
by the user, the editor shall quit.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_13_66"></a>edcompatible, ed</h5>

<p>[Default <i>unset</i>]</p>

<p>Causes the presence of <b>g</b> and <b>c</b> suffixes on substitute commands to be remembered, and toggled by repeating the
suffixes.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_13_67"></a>errorbells, eb</h5>

<p>[Default <i>unset</i>]</p>

<p>If the editor is in <i>ex</i> mode, and the terminal does not support a standout mode (such as inverse video), and
<b>errorbells</b> is set, error messages shall be preceded by alerting the terminal.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_13_68"></a>exrc</h5>

<p>[Default <i>unset</i>]</p>

<p>If <b>exrc</b> is set, <i>ex</i> shall access any <b>.exrc</b> file in the current directory, as described in <a href=
"#tag_20_40_13_01">Initialization in ex and vi</a>. If <b>exrc</b> is not set, <i>ex</i> shall ignore any <b>.exrc</b> file in the
current directory during initialization, unless the current directory is that named by the <i>HOME</i> environment variable.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_13_69"></a>ignorecase, ic</h5>

<p>[Default <i>unset</i>]</p>

<p>If <b>ignorecase</b> is set, characters that have uppercase and lowercase representations shall have those representations
considered as equivalent for purposes of regular expression comparison.</p>

<p>The <b>ignorecase</b> edit option shall affect all remembered regular expressions; for example, unsetting the <b>ignorecase</b>
edit option shall cause a subsequent <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> <b>n</b> command to search for the last basic
regular expression in a case-sensitive fashion.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_13_70"></a>list</h5>

<p>[Default <i>unset</i>]</p>

<p>If <b>list</b> is set, edit buffer lines written while in <i>ex</i> command mode shall be written as specified for the
<b>print</b> command with the <b>l</b> flag specified. In open or visual mode, each edit buffer line shall be displayed as
specified for the <i>ex</i> <b>print</b> command with the <b>l</b> flag specified. In open or visual text input mode, when the
cursor does not rest on any character in the line, it shall rest on the <tt>'$'</tt> marking the end of the line.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_13_72"></a>mesg</h5>

<p>[Default <i>set</i>]</p>

<p>If <b>mesg</b> is set, the permission for others to use the <b>write</b> or <b>talk</b> commands to write to the terminal shall
be turned on while in open or visual mode. The shell-level command <a href="../utilities/mesg.html"><i>mesg</i></a> <b>n</b> shall
take precedence over any setting of the <i>ex</i> <b>mesg</b> option; that is, if <b>mesg y</b> was issued before the editor
started (or in a shell escape), such as:</p>

<pre>
<tt>:!mesg y
</tt>
</pre>

<p>the <b>mesg</b> option in <i>ex</i> shall suppress incoming messages, but the <b>mesg</b> option shall not enable incoming
messages if <b>mesg n</b> was issued.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_13_73"></a>number, nu</h5>

<p>[Default <i>unset</i>]</p>

<p>If <b>number</b> is set, edit buffer lines written while in <i>ex</i> command mode shall be written with line numbers, in the
format specified by the <b>print</b> command with the <b>#</b> flag specified. In <i>ex</i> text input mode, each line shall be
preceded by the line number it will have in the file.</p>

<p>In open or visual mode, each edit buffer line shall be displayed with a preceding line number, in the format specified by the
<i>ex</i> <b>print</b> command with the <b>#</b> flag specified. This line number shall not be considered part of the line for the
purposes of evaluating the current column; that is, column position 1 shall be the first column position after the format specified
by the <b>print</b> command.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_13_74"></a>paragraphs, para</h5>

<p>[Default in the POSIX locale <tt>IPLPPPQPP LIpplpipbp</tt>]</p>

<p>The <b>paragraphs</b> edit option shall define additional paragraph boundaries for the open and visual mode commands. The
<b>paragraphs</b> edit option can be set to a character string consisting of zero or more character pairs. It shall be an error to
set it to an odd number of characters.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_13_75"></a>prompt</h5>

<p>[Default <i>set</i>]</p>

<p>If <b>prompt</b> is set, <i>ex</i> command mode input shall be prompted for with a &lt;colon&gt; ( <tt>':'</tt> ); when unset,
no prompt shall be written.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_13_76"></a>readonly</h5>

<p>[Default <i>see text</i>]</p>

<p>If the <b>readonly</b> edit option is set, read-only mode shall be enabled (see <a href="#tag_20_40_13_48">Write</a>). The
<b>readonly</b> edit option shall be initialized to set if either of the following conditions are true:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The command-line option -R was specified.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Performing actions equivalent to the <a href="../functions/access.html"><i>access</i>()</a> function called with the following
arguments indicates that the file lacks write permission:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The current pathname is used as the <i>path</i> argument.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The constant <b>W_OK</b> is used as the <i>amode</i> argument.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The <b>readonly</b> edit option may be initialized to set for other, implementation-defined reasons. The <b>readonly</b> edit
option shall not be initialized to unset based on any special privileges of the user or process. The <b>readonly</b> edit option
shall be reinitialized each time that the contents of the edit buffer are replaced (for example, by an <b>edit</b> or <b>next</b>
command) unless the user has explicitly set it, in which case it shall remain set until the user explicitly unsets it. Once unset,
it shall again be reinitialized each time that the contents of the edit buffer are replaced.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_13_77"></a>redraw</h5>

<p>[Default <i>unset</i>]</p>

<p>The editor simulates an intelligent terminal on a dumb terminal. (Since this is likely to require a large amount of output to
the terminal, it is useful only at high transmission speeds.)</p>

<p>If <b>warn</b> is set, and the contents of the edit buffer have been modified since they were last completely written, the

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_13_93"></a>window</h5>

<p>[Default <i>see text</i>]</p>

<p>A value used in open and visual mode, by the &lt;control&gt;-B and &lt;control&gt;-F commands, and, in visual mode, to specify
the number of lines displayed when the screen is repainted.</p>

<p>If the <b>-w</b> command-line option is not specified, the default value shall be set to the value of the <i>LINES</i>
environment variable. If the <i>LINES</i> environment variable is empty or null, the default shall be the number of lines in the
display minus 1.</p>

<p>Setting the <b>window</b> edit option to zero or to a value greater than the number of lines in the display minus 1 (either
explicitly or based on the <b>-w</b> option or the <i>LINES</i> environment variable) shall cause the <b>window</b> edit option to
be set to the number of lines in the display minus 1.</p>

<p>The baud rate of the terminal line may change the default in an implementation-defined manner.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_13_94"></a>wrapmargin, wm</h5>

<p>If the value of this edit option is zero, it shall have no effect.</p>

<p>If not in the POSIX locale, the effect of this edit option is implementation-defined.</p>

<p>Otherwise, it shall specify a number of columns from the ending margin of the terminal.</p>

<p>During open and visual text input modes, for each character for which any part of the character is displayed in a column that is
less than <b>wrapmargin</b> columns from the ending margin of the display line, the editor shall behave as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>If the character triggering this event is a &lt;blank&gt;, it, and all immediately preceding &lt;blank&gt; characters on the
current line entered during the execution of the current text input command, shall be discarded, and the editor shall behave as if
the user had entered a single &lt;newline&gt; instead. In addition, if the next user-entered character is a &lt;space&gt;, it shall
be discarded as well.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Otherwise, if there are one or more &lt;blank&gt; characters on the current line immediately preceding the last group of
inserted non- &lt;blank&gt; characters which was entered during the execution of the current text input command, the &lt;blank&gt;
characters shall be replaced as if the user had entered a single &lt;newline&gt; instead.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>If the <b>autoindent</b> edit option is set, and the events described in 1. or 2. are performed, any &lt;blank&gt; characters at
or after the cursor in the current line shall be discarded.</p>

<p>The ending margin shall be determined by the system or overridden by the user, as described for <i>COLUMNS</i> in the
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section and XBD <a href="../basedefs/V1_chap08.html#tag_08"><i>Environment Variables</i></a>.</p>

<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_20_40_18"></a>RATIONALE</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The <i>ex</i>/ <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> specification is based on the historical practice found in the 4 BSD
and System V implementations of <i>ex</i> and <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a>.</p>

<p>A <i>restricted editor</i> (both the historical <i>red</i> utility and modifications to <i>ex</i>) were considered and rejected
for inclusion. Neither option provided the level of security that users might expect.</p>

<p>It is recognized that <i>ex</i> visual mode and related features would be difficult, if not impossible, to implement
satisfactorily on a block-mode terminal, or a terminal without any form of cursor addressing; thus, it is not a mandatory
requirement that such features should work on all terminals. It is the intention, however, that an <i>ex</i> implementation should
provide the full set of capabilities on all terminals capable of supporting them.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_01"></a>Options</h5>

<p>The <b>-c</b> replacement for <b>+</b> <i>command</i> was inspired by the <b>-e</b> option of <a href=
"../utilities/sed.html"><i>sed</i></a>. Historically, all such commands (see <b>edit</b> and <b>next</b> as well) were executed
from the last line of the edit buffer. This meant, for example, that <tt>"+/pattern"</tt> would fail unless the <b>wrapscan</b>
option was set. POSIX.1-2017 requires conformance to historical practice. The <b>+</b> <i>command</i> option is no longer specified
by POSIX.1-2017 but may be present in some implementations. Historically, some implementations restricted the <i>ex</i> commands
that could be listed as part of the command line arguments. For consistency, POSIX.1-2017 does not permit these restrictions.</p>

<p>In historical implementations of the editor, the <b>-R</b> option (and the <b>readonly</b> edit option) only prevented
overwriting of files; appending to files was still permitted, mapping loosely into the <i>csh</i> <b>noclobber</b> variable. Some
implementations, however, have not followed this semantic, and <b>readonly</b> does not permit appending either. POSIX.1-2017
follows the latter practice, believing that it is a more obvious and intuitive meaning of <b>readonly</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>-s</b> option suppresses all interactive user feedback and is useful for editing scripts in batch jobs. The list of
specific effects is historical practice. The terminal type &quot;incapable of supporting open and visual modes&quot; has historically been
named &quot;dumb&quot;.</p>

<p>The <b>-t</b> option was required because the <a href="../utilities/ctags.html"><i>ctags</i></a> utility appears in POSIX.1-2017
and the option is available in all historical implementations of <i>ex</i>.</p>

<p>Historically, the <i>ex</i> and <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> utilities accepted a <b>-x</b> option, which did
encryption based on the algorithm found in the historical <i>crypt</i> utility. The <b>-x</b> option for encryption, and the
associated <i>crypt</i> utility, were omitted because the algorithm used was not specifiable and the export control laws of some
nations make it difficult to export cryptographic technology. In addition, it did not historically provide the level of security
that users might expect.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_02"></a>Standard Input</h5>

<p>An end-of-file condition is not equivalent to an end-of-file character. A common end-of-file character, &lt;control&gt;-D, is
historically an <i>ex</i> command.</p>

<p>There was no maximum line length in historical implementations of <i>ex</i>. Specifically, as it was parsed in chunks, the
addresses had a different maximum length than the filenames. Further, the maximum line buffer size was declared as BUFSIZ, which
was different lengths on different systems. This version selected the value of {LINE_MAX} to impose a reasonable restriction on
portable usage of <i>ex</i> and to aid test suite writers in their development of realistic tests that exercise this limit.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_03"></a>Input Files</h5>

<p>It was an explicit decision by the standard developers that a &lt;newline&gt; be added to any file lacking one. It was believed
that this feature of <i>ex</i> and <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> was relied on by users in order to make text files
lacking a trailing &lt;newline&gt; more portable. It is recognized that this will require a user-specified option or extension for
implementations that permit <i>ex</i> and <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> to edit files of type other than text if
such files are not otherwise identified by the system. It was agreed that the ability to edit files of arbitrary type can be
useful, but it was not considered necessary to mandate that an <i>ex</i> or <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a>
implementation be required to handle files other than text files.</p>

<p>The paragraph in the INPUT FILES section, &quot;By default, ...&quot;, is intended to close a long-standing security problem in
<i>ex</i> and <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a>; that of the &quot;modeline&quot; or &quot;modelines&quot; edit option. This feature
allows any line in the first or last five lines of the file containing the strings <tt>"ex:"</tt> or <tt>"vi:"</tt> (and,
apparently, <tt>"ei:"</tt> or <tt>"vx:"</tt> ) to be a line containing editor commands, and <i>ex</i> interprets all the text up to
the next <tt>':'</tt> or &lt;newline&gt; as a command. Consider the consequences, for example, of an unsuspecting user using
<i>ex</i> or <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> as the editor when replying to a mail message in which a line such
as:</p>

<pre>
<tt>ex:! rm -rf :
</tt>
</pre>

<p>appeared in the signature lines. The standard developers believed strongly that an editor should not by default interpret any
lines of a file. Vendors are strongly urged to delete this feature from their implementations of <i>ex</i> and <a href=
"../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a>.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_04"></a>Asynchronous Events</h5>

<p>The intention of the phrase &quot;complete write&quot; is that the entire edit buffer be written to stable storage. The note regarding
temporary files is intended for implementations that use temporary files to back edit buffers unnamed by the user.</p>

<p>Historically, SIGQUIT was ignored by <i>ex</i>, but was the equivalent of the <b>Q</b> command in visual mode; that is, it
exited visual mode and entered <i>ex</i> mode. POSIX.1-2017 permits, but does not require, this behavior. Historically, SIGINT was
often used by <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> users to terminate text input mode ( &lt;control&gt;-C is often easier
to enter than &lt;ESC&gt;). Some implementations of <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> alerted the terminal on this
event, and some did not. POSIX.1-2017 requires that SIGINT behave identically to &lt;ESC&gt;, and that the terminal not be
alerted.</p>

<p>Historically, suspending the <i>ex</i> editor during text input mode was similar to SIGINT, as completed lines were retained,
but any partial line discarded, and the editor returned to command mode. POSIX.1-2017 is silent on this issue; implementations are
encouraged to follow historical practice, where possible.</p>

<p>Historically, the <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> editor did not treat SIGTSTP as an asynchronous event, and it was
therefore impossible to suspend the editor in visual text input mode. There are two major reasons for this. The first is that
SIGTSTP is a broadcast signal on UNIX systems, and the chain of events where the shell <a href=
"../utilities/V3_chap02.html#exec"><i>exec</i></a>s an application that then <a href=
"../utilities/V3_chap02.html#exec"><i>exec</i></a>s <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> usually caused confusion for the
terminal state if SIGTSTP was delivered to the process group in the default manner. The second was that most implementations of the
UNIX <i>curses</i> package did not handle SIGTSTP safely, and the receipt of SIGTSTP at the wrong time would cause them to crash.
POSIX.1-2017 is silent on this issue; implementations are encouraged to treat suspension as an asynchronous event if possible.</p>

<p>Historically, modifications to the edit buffer made before SIGINT interrupted an operation were retained; that is, anywhere from
zero to all of the lines to be modified might have been modified by the time the SIGINT arrived. These changes were not discarded
by the arrival of SIGINT. POSIX.1-2017 permits this behavior, noting that the <b>undo</b> command is required to be able to undo
these partially completed commands.</p>

<p>The action taken for signals other than SIGINT, SIGCONT, SIGHUP, and SIGTERM is unspecified because some implementations attempt
to save the edit buffer in a useful state when other signals are received.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_05"></a>Standard Error</h5>

<p>For <i>ex</i>/ <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a>, diagnostic messages are those messages reported as a result of a
failed attempt to invoke <i>ex</i> or <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a>, such as invalid options or insufficient
resources, or an abnormal termination condition. Diagnostic messages should not be confused with the error messages generated by
inappropriate or illegal user commands.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_06"></a>Initialization in ex and vi</h5>

<p>If an <i>ex</i> command (other than <b>cd</b>, <b>chdir</b>, or <b>source</b>) has a filename argument, one or both of the
alternate and current pathnames will be set. Informally, they are set as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>If the <i>ex</i> command is one that replaces the contents of the edit buffer, and it succeeds, the current pathname will be set
to the filename argument (the first filename argument in the case of the <b>next</b> command) and the alternate pathname will be
set to the previous current pathname, if there was one.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In the case of the file read/write forms of the <b>read</b> and <b>write</b> commands, if there is no current pathname, the
current pathname will be set to the filename argument.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Otherwise, the alternate pathname will be set to the filename argument.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, <b>:edit foo</b> and <b>:recover foo</b>, when successful, set the current pathname, and, if there was a previous
current pathname, the alternate pathname. The commands <b>:write</b>, <b>!command</b>, and <b>:edit</b> set neither the current or
alternate pathnames. If the <b>:edit foo</b> command were to fail for some reason, the alternate pathname would be set. The
<b>read</b> and <b>write</b> commands set the alternate pathname to their <i>file</i> argument, unless the current pathname is not
set, in which case they set the current pathname to their <i>file</i> arguments. The alternate pathname was not historically set by
the <b>:source</b> command. POSIX.1-2017 requires conformance to historical practice. Implementations adding commands that take
filenames as arguments are encouraged to set the alternate pathname as described here.</p>

<p>Historically, <i>ex</i> and <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> read the <b>.exrc</b> file in the <i>$HOME</i>
directory twice, if the editor was executed in the <i>$HOME</i> directory. POSIX.1-2017 prohibits this behavior.</p>

<p>Historically, the 4 BSD <i>ex</i> and <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> read the <i>$HOME</i> and local <b>.exrc</b>
files if they were owned by the real ID of the user, or the <b>sourceany</b> option was set, regardless of other considerations.
This was a security problem because it is possible to put normal UNIX system commands inside a <b>.exrc</b> file. POSIX.1-2017 does
not specify the <b>sourceany</b> option, and historical implementations are encouraged to delete it.</p>

<p>The <b>.exrc</b> files must be owned by the real ID of the user, and not writable by anyone other than the owner. The
appropriate privileges exception is intended to permit users to acquire special privileges, but continue to use the <b>.exrc</b>
files in their home directories.</p>

<p>System V Release 3.2 and later <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> implementations added the option <b>[no]exrc</b>.
The behavior is that local <b>.exrc</b> files are read-only if the <b>exrc</b> option is set. The default for the <b>exrc</b>
option was off, so by default, local <b>.exrc</b> files were not read. The problem this was intended to solve was that System V
permitted users to give away files, so there is no possible ownership or writeability test to ensure that the file is safe. This is
still a security problem on systems where users can give away files, but there is nothing additional that POSIX.1-2017 can do. The
implementation-defined exception is intended to permit groups to have local <b>.exrc</b> files that are shared by users, by
creating pseudo-users to own the shared files.</p>

<p>POSIX.1-2017 does not mention system-wide <i>ex</i> and <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> start-up files. While they
exist in several implementations of <i>ex</i> and <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a>, they are not present in any
implementations considered historical practice by POSIX.1-2017. Implementations that have such files should use them only if they
are owned by the real user ID or an appropriate user (for example, root on UNIX systems) and if they are not writable by any user
other than their owner. System-wide start-up files should be read before the <i>EXINIT</i> variable, <b>$HOME/.exrc</b>, or local
<b>.exrc</b> files are evaluated.</p>

<p>Historically, any <i>ex</i> command could be entered in the <i>EXINIT</i> variable or the <b>.exrc</b> file, although ones
requiring that the edit buffer already contain lines of text generally caused historical implementations of the editor to drop
<b>core</b>. POSIX.1-2017 requires that any <i>ex</i> command be permitted in the <i>EXINIT</i> variable and <b>.exrc</b> files,
for simplicity of specification and consistency, although many of them will obviously fail under many circumstances.</p>

<p>The initialization of the contents of the edit buffer uses the phrase &quot;the effect shall be&quot; with regard to various <i>ex</i>
commands. The intent of this phrase is that edit buffer contents loaded during the initialization phase not be lost; that is,
loading the edit buffer should fail if the <b>.exrc</b> file read in the contents of a file and did not subsequently write the edit
buffer. An additional intent of this phrase is to specify that the initial current line and column is set as specified for the
individual <i>ex</i> commands.</p>

<p>Historically, the <b>-t</b> option behaved as if the tag search were a <b>+</b> <i>command</i>; that is, it was executed from
the last line of the file specified by the tag. This resulted in the search failing if the pattern was a forward search pattern and
the <b>wrapscan</b> edit option was not set. POSIX.1-2017 does not permit this behavior, requiring that the search for the tag
pattern be performed on the entire file, and, if not found, that the current line be set to a more reasonable location in the
file.</p>

<p>Historically, the empty edit buffer presented for editing when a file was not specified by the user was unnamed. This is
permitted by POSIX.1-2017; however, implementations are encouraged to provide users a temporary filename for this buffer because it
permits them the use of <i>ex</i> commands that use the current pathname during temporary edit sessions.</p>

<p>Historically, the file specified using the <b>-t</b> option was not part of the current argument list. This practice is
permitted by POSIX.1-2017; however, implementations are encouraged to include its name in the current argument list for
consistency.</p>

<p>Historically, the <b>-c</b> command was generally not executed until a file that already exists was edited. POSIX.1-2017
requires conformance to this historical practice. Commands that could cause the <b>-c</b> command to be executed include the
<i>ex</i> commands <b>edit</b>, <b>next</b>, <b>recover</b>, <b>rewind</b>, and <b>tag</b>, and the <a href=
"../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> commands &lt;control&gt;-^ and &lt;control&gt;-]. Historically, reading a file into an edit
buffer did not cause the <b>-c</b> command to be executed (even though it might set the current pathname) with the exception that
it did cause the <b>-c</b> command to be executed if: the editor was in <i>ex</i> mode, the edit buffer had no current pathname,
the edit buffer was empty, and no read commands had yet been attempted. For consistency and simplicity of specification,
POSIX.1-2017 does not permit this behavior.</p>

<p>Historically, the <b>-r</b> option was the same as a normal edit session if there was no recovery information available for the
file. This allowed users to enter:</p>

<pre>
<tt>vi -r *.c
</tt>
</pre>

<p>and recover whatever files were recoverable. In some implementations, recovery was attempted only on the first file named, and
the file was not entered into the argument list; in others, recovery was attempted for each file named. In addition, some
historical implementations ignored <b>-r</b> if <b>-t</b> was specified or did not support command line <i>file</i> arguments with
the <b>-t</b> option. For consistency and simplicity of specification, POSIX.1-2017 disallows these special cases, and requires
that recovery be attempted the first time each file is edited.</p>

<p>Historically, <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> initialized the <b>`</b> and <b>'</b> marks, but <i>ex</i> did not.
This meant that if the first command in <i>ex</i> mode was <b>visual</b> or if an <i>ex</i> command was executed first (for
example, <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> +10 <i>file</i>), <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> was entered
without the marks being initialized. Because the standard developers believed the marks to be generally useful, and for consistency
and simplicity of specification, POSIX.1-2017 requires that they always be initialized if in open or visual mode, or if in
<i>ex</i> mode and the edit buffer is not empty. Not initializing it in <i>ex</i> mode if the edit buffer is empty is historical
practice; however, it has always been possible to set (and use) marks in empty edit buffers in open and visual mode edit
sessions.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_07"></a>Addressing</h5>

<p>Historically, <i>ex</i> and <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> accepted the additional addressing forms <tt>'\/'</tt>
and <tt>'\?'</tt>. They were equivalent to <tt>"//"</tt> and <tt>"??"</tt>, respectively. They are not required by POSIX.1-2017,
mostly because nobody can remember whether they ever did anything different historically.</p>

<p>Historically, <i>ex</i> and <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> permitted an address of zero for several commands, and
permitted the <b>%</b> address in empty files for others. For consistency, POSIX.1-2017 requires support for the former in the few
commands where it makes sense, and disallows it otherwise. In addition, because POSIX.1-2017 requires that <b>%</b> be logically
equivalent to <tt>"1,$"</tt>, it is also supported where it makes sense and disallowed otherwise.</p>

<p>Historically, the <b>%</b> address could not be followed by further addresses. For consistency and simplicity of specification,
POSIX.1-2017 requires that additional addresses be supported.</p>

<p>All of the following are valid <i>addresses</i>:</p>

<dl compact>
<dt><tt>+++</tt></dt>

<dd>Three lines after the current line.</dd>

<dt><tt>/</tt><i>re</i><tt>/-</tt></dt>

<dd>One line before the next occurrence of <i>re</i>.</dd>

<dt><tt>-2</tt></dt>

<dd>Two lines before the current line.</dd>

<dt><tt>3&nbsp;----&nbsp;2</tt></dt>

<dd>Line one (note intermediate negative address).</dd>

<dt><tt>1&nbsp;2&nbsp;3</tt></dt>

<dd>Line six.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Any number of addresses can be provided to commands taking addresses; for example, <tt>"1,2,3,4,5p"</tt> prints lines 4 and 5,
because two is the greatest valid number of addresses accepted by the <b>print</b> command. This, in combination with the
&lt;semicolon&gt; delimiter, permits users to create commands based on ordered patterns in the file. For example, the command
<b>3;/foo/;+2print</b> will display the first line after line 3 that contains the pattern <i>foo</i>, plus the next two lines. Note
that the address <b>3;</b> must be evaluated before being discarded because the search origin for the <b>/foo/</b> command depends
on this.</p>

<p>Historically, values could be added to addresses by including them after one or more &lt;blank&gt; characters; for example,
<b>3&nbsp;-&nbsp;5p</b> wrote the seventh line of the file, and <b>/foo/&nbsp;5</b> was the same as <b>/foo/+5</b>. However, only
absolute values could be added; for example, <b>5&nbsp;/foo/</b> was an error. POSIX.1-2017 requires conformance to historical
practice. Address offsets are separately specified from addresses because they could historically be provided to visual mode search
commands.</p>

<p>Historically, any missing addresses defaulted to the current line. This was true for leading and trailing
&lt;comma&gt;-delimited addresses, and for trailing &lt;semicolon&gt;-delimited addresses. For consistency, POSIX.1-2017 requires
it for leading &lt;semicolon&gt; addresses as well.</p>

<p>Historically, <i>ex</i> and <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> accepted the <tt>'^'</tt> character as both an address
and as a flag offset for commands. In both cases it was identical to the <tt>'-'</tt> character. POSIX.1-2017 does not require or
prohibit this behavior.</p>

<p>Historically, the enhancements to basic regular expressions could be used in addressing; for example, <tt>'&#152;'</tt>,
<tt>'\&lt;'</tt>, and <tt>'\&gt;'</tt>. POSIX.1-2017 requires conformance to historical practice; that is, that regular
expression usage be consistent, and that regular expression enhancements be supported wherever regular expressions are used.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_08"></a>Command Line Parsing in ex</h5>

<p>Historical <i>ex</i> command parsing was even more complex than that described here. POSIX.1-2017 requires the subset of the
command parsing that the standard developers believed was documented and that users could reasonably be expected to use in a
portable fashion, and that was historically consistent between implementations. (The discarded functionality is obscure, at best.)
Historical implementations will require changes in order to comply with POSIX.1-2017; however, users are not expected to notice any
of these changes. Most of the complexity in <i>ex</i> parsing is to handle three special termination cases:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The <b>!</b>, <b>global</b>, <b>v</b>, and the filter versions of the <b>read</b> and <b>write</b> commands are delimited by
&lt;newline&gt; characters (they can contain &lt;vertical-line&gt; characters that are usually shell pipes).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The <b>ex</b>, <b>edit</b>, <b>next</b>, and <b>visual</b> in open and visual mode commands all take <i>ex</i> commands,
optionally containing &lt;vertical-line&gt; characters, as their first arguments.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The <b>s</b> command takes a regular expression as its first argument, and uses the delimiting characters to delimit the
command.</p>

<p>Historically, &lt;vertical-line&gt; characters in the <b>+</b> <i>command</i> argument of the <b>ex</b>, <b>edit</b>,
<b>next</b>, <b>vi</b>, and <b>visual</b> commands, and in the <i>pattern</i> and <i>replacement</i> parts of the <b>s</b> command,
did not delimit the command, and in the filter cases for <b>read</b> and <b>write</b>, and the <b>!</b>, <b>global</b>, and
<b>v</b> commands, they did not delimit the command at all. For example, the following commands are all valid:</p>

<pre>
<b>:</b><tt>edit +25 | s/abc/ABC/ file.c
</tt><b>:</b><tt>s/ | /PIPE/
</tt><b>:</b><tt>read !spell % | columnate
</tt><b>:</b><tt>global/pattern/p | l
</tt><b>:</b><tt>s/a/b/ | s/c/d | set
</tt>
</pre>

<p>Historically, empty or &lt;blank&gt; filled lines in <b>.exrc</b> files and <b>source</b>d files (as well as <i>EXINIT</i>
variables and <i>ex</i> command scripts) were treated as default commands; that is, <b>print</b> commands. POSIX.1-2017
specifically requires that they be ignored when encountered in <b>.exrc</b> and <b>source</b>d files to eliminate a common source
of new user error.</p>

<p>Historically, <i>ex</i> commands with multiple adjacent (or &lt;blank&gt;-separated) vertical lines were handled oddly when
executed from <i>ex</i> mode. For example, the command <b>|||</b> &lt;carriage-return&gt;, when the cursor was on line 1, displayed
lines 2, 3, and 5 of the file. In addition, the command <b>|</b> would only display the line after the next line, instead of the
next two lines. The former worked more logically when executed from <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> mode, and
displayed lines 2, 3, and 4. POSIX.1-2017 requires the <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> behavior; that is, a single
default command and line number increment for each command separator, and trailing &lt;newline&gt; characters after
&lt;vertical-line&gt; separators are discarded.</p>

<p>Historically, <i>ex</i> permitted a single extra &lt;colon&gt; as a leading command character; for example, <b>:g/pattern/:p</b>
was a valid command. POSIX.1-2017 generalizes this to require that any number of leading &lt;colon&gt; characters be stripped.</p>

<p>Historically, any prefix of the <b>delete</b> command could be followed without intervening &lt;blank&gt; characters by a flag
character because in the command <b>d&nbsp;p</b>, <i>p</i> is interpreted as the buffer <i>p</i>. POSIX.1-2017 requires conformance
to historical practice.</p>

<p>Historically, the <b>k</b> command could be followed by the mark name without intervening &lt;blank&gt; characters. POSIX.1-2017
requires conformance to historical practice.</p>

<p>Historically, the <b>s</b> command could be immediately followed by flag and option characters; for example,
<b>s/e/E/|s|sgc3p</b> was a valid command. However, flag characters could not stand alone; for example, the commands <b>sp</b> and
<b>s&nbsp;l</b> would fail, while the command <b>sgp</b> and <b>s&nbsp;gl</b> would succeed. (Obviously, the <tt>'#'</tt> flag
character was used as a delimiter character if it followed the command.) Another issue was that option characters had to precede
flag characters even when the command was fully specified; for example, the command <b>s/e/E/pg</b> would fail, while the command
<b>s/e/E/gp</b> would succeed. POSIX.1-2017 requires conformance to historical practice.</p>

<p>Historically, the first command name that had a prefix matching the input from the user was the executed command; for example,
<b>ve</b>, <b>ver</b>, and <b>vers</b> all executed the <b>version</b> command. Commands were in a specific order, however, so that
<b>a</b> matched <b>append</b>, not <b>abbreviate</b>. POSIX.1-2017 requires conformance to historical practice. The restriction on
command search order for implementations with extensions is to avoid the addition of commands such that the historical prefixes
would fail to work portably.</p>

<p>Historical implementations of <i>ex</i> and <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> did not correctly handle multiple
<i>ex</i> commands, separated by &lt;vertical-line&gt; characters, that entered or exited visual mode or the editor. Because
implementations of <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> exist that do not exhibit this failure mode, POSIX.1-2017 does not
permit it.</p>

<p>The requirement that alphabetic command names consist of all following alphabetic characters up to the next non-alphabetic
character means that alphabetic command names must be separated from their arguments by one or more non-alphabetic characters,
normally a &lt;blank&gt; or <tt>'!'</tt> character, except as specified for the exceptions, the <b>delete</b>, <b>k</b>, and
<b>s</b> commands.</p>

<p>Historically, the repeated execution of the <i>ex</i> default <b>print</b> commands ( &lt;control&gt;-D, <i>eof</i>,
&lt;newline&gt;, &lt;carriage-return&gt;) erased any prompting character and displayed the next lines without scrolling the
terminal; that is, immediately below any previously displayed lines. This provided a cleaner presentation of the lines in the file
for the user. POSIX.1-2017 does not require this behavior because it may be impossible in some situations; however, implementations
are strongly encouraged to provide this semantic if possible.</p>

<p>Historically, it was possible to change files in the middle of a command, and have the rest of the command executed in the new
file; for example:</p>

<pre>
<tt>:edit +25 file.c | s/abc/ABC/ | 1
</tt>
</pre>

<p>was a valid command, and the substitution was attempted in the newly edited file. POSIX.1-2017 requires conformance to
historical practice. The following commands are examples that exercise the <i>ex</i> parser:</p>

<pre>
<tt>echo 'foo | bar' &gt; file1; echo 'foo/bar' &gt; file2;
vi
:edit +1 | s/|/PIPE/ | w file1 | e file2 | 1 | s/\//SLASH/ | wq
</tt>
</pre>

<p>Historically, there was no protection in editor implementations to avoid <i>ex</i> <b>global</b>, <b>v</b>, <b>@</b>, or
<b>*</b> commands changing edit buffers during execution of their associated commands. Because this would almost invariably result
in catastrophic failure of the editor, and implementations exist that do exhibit these problems, POSIX.1-2017 requires that
changing the edit buffer during a <b>global</b> or <b>v</b> command, or during a <b>@</b> or <b>*</b> command for which there will
be more than a single execution, be an error. Implementations supporting multiple edit buffers simultaneously are strongly
encouraged to apply the same semantics to switching between buffers as well.</p>

<p>The <i>ex</i> command quoting required by POSIX.1-2017 is a superset of the quoting in historical implementations of the editor.
For example, it was not historically possible to escape a &lt;blank&gt; in a filename; for example,
<b>:edit&nbsp;foo\\\&nbsp;bar</b> would report that too many filenames had been entered for the edit command, and there was no
method of escaping a &lt;blank&gt; in the first argument of an <b>edit</b>, <b>ex</b>, <b>next</b>, or <b>visual</b> command at
all. POSIX.1-2017 extends historical practice, requiring that quoting behavior be made consistent across all <i>ex</i> commands,
except for the <b>map</b>, <b>unmap</b>, <b>abbreviate</b>, and <b>unabbreviate</b> commands, which historically used
&lt;control&gt;-V instead of &lt;backslash&gt; characters for quoting. For those four commands, POSIX.1-2017 requires conformance
to historical practice.</p>

<p>Backslash quoting in <i>ex</i> is non-intuitive. &lt;backslash&gt;-escapes are ignored unless they escape a special character;
for example, when performing <i>file</i> argument expansion, the string <tt>"\\%"</tt> is equivalent to <tt>'\%'</tt>, not
<tt>"\&lt;</tt><i>current&nbsp;pathname</i><tt>&gt;"</tt>. This can be confusing for users because &lt;backslash&gt; is usually one
of the characters that causes shell expansion to be performed, and therefore shell quoting rules must be taken into consideration.
Generally, quoting characters are only considered if they escape a special character, and a quoting character must be provided for
each layer of parsing for which the character is special. As another example, only a single &lt;backslash&gt; is necessary for the
<tt>'\l'</tt> sequence in substitute replacement patterns, because the character <tt>'l'</tt> is not special to any parsing layer
above it.</p>

<p>&lt;control&gt;-V quoting in <i>ex</i> is slightly different from backslash quoting. In the four commands where
&lt;control&gt;-V quoting applies (<b>abbreviate</b>, <b>unabbreviate</b>, <b>map</b>, and <b>unmap</b>), any character may be
escaped by a &lt;control&gt;-V whether it would have a special meaning or not. POSIX.1-2017 requires conformance to historical
practice.</p>

<p>Historical implementations of the editor did not require delimiters within character classes to be escaped; for example, the
command <b>:s/[/]//</b> on the string <tt>"xxx/yyy"</tt> would delete the <tt>'/'</tt> from the string. POSIX.1-2017 disallows this
historical practice for consistency and because it places a large burden on implementations by requiring that knowledge of regular
expressions be built into the editor parser.</p>

<p>Historically, quoting &lt;newline&gt; characters in <i>ex</i> commands was handled inconsistently. In most cases, the
&lt;newline&gt; character always terminated the command, regardless of any preceding escape character, because &lt;backslash&gt;
characters did not escape &lt;newline&gt; characters for most <i>ex</i> commands. However, some <i>ex</i> commands (for example,
<b>s</b>, <b>map</b>, and <b>abbreviation</b>) permitted &lt;newline&gt; characters to be escaped (although in the case of
<b>map</b> and <b>abbreviation</b>, &lt;control&gt;-V characters escaped them instead of &lt;backslash&gt; characters). This was
true in not only the command line, but also <b>.exrc</b> and <b>source</b>d files. For example, the command:</p>

<pre>
<tt>map = foo&lt;control-V&gt;&lt;newline&gt;bar
</tt>
</pre>

<p>would succeed, although it was sometimes difficult to get the &lt;control&gt;-V and the inserted &lt;newline&gt; passed to the
<i>ex</i> parser. For consistency and simplicity of specification, POSIX.1-2017 requires that it be possible to escape
&lt;newline&gt; characters in <i>ex</i> commands at all times, using &lt;backslash&gt; characters for most <i>ex</i> commands, and
using &lt;control&gt;-V characters for the <b>map</b> and <b>abbreviation</b> commands. For example, the command <b>print</b>
&lt;newline&gt; <b>list</b> is required to be parsed as the single command <b>print</b> &lt;newline&gt; <b>list</b>. While this
differs from historical practice, POSIX.1-2017 developers believed it unlikely that any script or user depended on the historical
behavior.</p>

<p>Historically, an error in a command specified using the <b>-c</b> option did not cause the rest of the <b>-c</b> commands to be
discarded. POSIX.1-2017 disallows this for consistency with mapped keys, the <b>@</b>, <b>global</b>, <b>source</b>, and <b>v</b>
commands, the <i>EXINIT</i> environment variable, and the <b>.exrc</b> files.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_09"></a>Input Editing in ex</h5>

<p>One of the common uses of the historical <i>ex</i> editor is over slow network connections. Editors that run in canonical mode
can require far less traffic to and from, and far less processing on, the host machine, as well as more easily supporting
block-mode terminals. For these reasons, POSIX.1-2017 requires that <i>ex</i> be implemented using canonical mode input processing,
as was done historically.</p>

<p>POSIX.1-2017 does not require the historical 4 BSD input editing characters &quot;word erase&quot; or &quot;literal next&quot;. For this reason,
it is unspecified how they are handled by <i>ex</i>, although they must have the required effect. Implementations that resolve them
after the line has been ended using a &lt;newline&gt; or &lt;control&gt;-M character, and implementations that rely on the
underlying system terminal support for this processing, are both conforming. Implementations are strongly urged to use the
underlying system functionality, if at all possible, for compatibility with other system text input interfaces.</p>

<p>Historically, when the <i>eof</i> character was used to decrement the <b>autoindent</b> level, the cursor moved to display the
new end of the <b>autoindent</b> characters, but did not move the cursor to a new line, nor did it erase the &lt;control&gt;-D
character from the line. POSIX.1-2017 does not specify that the cursor remain on the same line or that the rest of the line is
erased; however, implementations are strongly encouraged to provide the best possible user interface; that is, the cursor should
remain on the same line, and any &lt;control&gt;-D character on the line should be erased.</p>

<p>POSIX.1-2017 does not require the historical 4 BSD input editing character &quot;reprint&quot;, traditionally &lt;control&gt;-R, which
redisplayed the current input from the user. For this reason, and because the functionality cannot be implemented after the line
has been terminated by the user, POSIX.1-2017 makes no requirements about this functionality. Implementations are strongly urged to
make this historical functionality available, if possible.</p>

<p>Historically, &lt;control&gt;-Q did not perform a literal next function in <i>ex</i>, as it did in <a href=
"../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a>. POSIX.1-2017 requires conformance to historical practice to avoid breaking historical
<i>ex</i> scripts and <b>.exrc</b> files.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_10"></a>eof</h5>

<p>Whether the <i>eof</i> character immediately modifies the <b>autoindent</b> characters in the prompt is left unspecified so that
implementations can conform in the presence of systems that do not support this functionality. Implementations are encouraged to
modify the line and redisplay it immediately, if possible.</p>

<p>The specification of the handling of the <i>eof</i> character differs from historical practice only in that <i>eof</i>
characters are not discarded if they follow normal characters in the text input. Historically, they were always discarded.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_11"></a>Command Descriptions in ex</h5>

<p>Historically, several commands (for example, <b>global</b>, <b>v</b>, <b>visual</b>, <b>s</b>, <b>write</b>, <b>wq</b>,
<b>yank</b>, <b>!</b>, <b>&lt;</b>, <b>&gt;</b>, <b>&amp;</b>, and <b>&#152;</b>) were executable in empty files (that is, the
default address(es) were 0), or permitted explicit addresses of 0 (for example, 0 was a valid address, or 0,0 was a valid range).
Addresses of 0, or command execution in an empty file, make sense only for commands that add new text to the edit buffer or write
commands (because users may wish to write empty files). POSIX.1-2017 requires this behavior for such commands and disallows it
otherwise, for consistency and simplicity of specification.</p>

<p>A count to an <i>ex</i> command has been historically corrected to be no greater than the last line in a file; for example, in a
five-line file, the command <b>1,6print</b> would fail, but the command <b>1print300</b> would succeed. POSIX.1-2017 requires
conformance to historical practice.</p>

<p>Historically, the use of flags in <i>ex</i> commands could be obscure. General historical practice was as described by
POSIX.1-2017, but there were some special cases. For instance, the <b>list</b>, <b>number</b>, and <b>print</b> commands ignored
trailing address offsets; for example, <b>3p&nbsp;+++#</b> would display line 3, and 3 would be the current line after the
execution of the command. The <b>open</b> and <b>visual</b> commands ignored both the trailing offsets and the trailing flags.
Also, flags specified to the <b>open</b> and <b>visual</b> commands interacted badly with the <b>list</b> edit option, and setting
and then unsetting it during the open/visual session would cause <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> to stop displaying
lines in the specified format. For consistency and simplicity of specification, POSIX.1-2017 does not permit any of these
exceptions to the general rule.</p>

<p>POSIX.1-2017 uses the word <i>copy</i> in several places when discussing buffers. This is not intended to imply
implementation.</p>

<p>Historically, <i>ex</i> users could not specify numeric buffers because of the ambiguity this would cause; for example, in the
command <b>3&nbsp;delete&nbsp;2</b>, it is unclear whether 2 is a buffer name or a <i>count</i>. POSIX.1-2017 requires conformance
to historical practice by default, but does not preclude extensions.</p>

<p>Historically, the contents of the unnamed buffer were frequently discarded after commands that did not explicitly affect it; for
example, when using the <b>edit</b> command to switch files. For consistency and simplicity of specification, POSIX.1-2017 does not
permit this behavior.</p>

<p>The <i>ex</i> utility did not historically have access to the numeric buffers, and, furthermore, deleting lines in <i>ex</i> did
not modify their contents. For example, if, after doing a delete in <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a>, the user switched
to <i>ex</i>, did another delete, and then switched back to <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a>, the contents of the
numeric buffers would not have changed. POSIX.1-2017 requires conformance to historical practice. Numeric buffers are described in
the <i>ex</i> utility in order to confine the description of buffers to a single location in POSIX.1-2017.</p>

<p>The metacharacters that trigger shell expansion in <i>file</i> arguments match historical practice, as does the method for doing
shell expansion. Implementations wishing to provide users with the flexibility to alter the set of metacharacters are encouraged to
provide a <b>shellmeta</b> string edit option.</p>

<p>Historically, <i>ex</i> commands executed from <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> refreshed the screen when it did not
strictly need to do so; for example, <b>:!date&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;/dev/null</b> does not require a screen refresh because the output of
the UNIX <a href="../utilities/date.html"><i>date</i></a> command requires only a single line of the screen. POSIX.1-2017 requires
that the screen be refreshed if it has been overwritten, but makes no requirements as to how an implementation should make that
determination. Implementations may prompt and refresh the screen regardless.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_12"></a>Abbreviate</h5>

<p>Historical practice was that characters that were entered as part of an abbreviation replacement were subject to <b>map</b>
expansions, the <b>showmatch</b> edit option, further abbreviation expansions, and so on; that is, they were logically pushed onto
the terminal input queue, and were not a simple replacement. POSIX.1-2017 requires conformance to historical practice. Historical
practice was that whenever a non-word character (that had not been escaped by a &lt;control&gt;-V) was entered after a word
character, <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> would check for abbreviations. The check was based on the type of the
character entered before the word character of the word/non-word pair that triggered the check. The word character of the
word/non-word pair that triggered the check and all characters entered before the trigger pair that were of that type were included
in the check, with the exception of &lt;blank&gt; characters, which always delimited the abbreviation.</p>

<p>This means that, for the abbreviation to work, the <i>lhs</i> must end with a word character, there can be no transitions from
word to non-word characters (or <i>vice versa</i>) other than between the last and next-to-last characters in the <i>lhs</i>, and
there can be no &lt;blank&gt; characters in the <i>lhs</i>. In addition, because of the historical quoting rules, it was impossible
to enter a literal &lt;control&gt;-V in the <i>lhs</i>. POSIX.1-2017 requires conformance to historical practice. Historical
implementations did not inform users when abbreviations that could never be used were entered; implementations are strongly
encouraged to do so.<br>
</p>

<p>For example, the following abbreviations will work:</p>

<pre>
<tt>:ab (p  REPLACE
:ab p   REPLACE
:ab ((p REPLACE
</tt>
</pre>

<p>The following abbreviations will not work:</p>

<pre>
<tt>:ab (   REPLACE
:ab (pp REPLACE
</tt>
</pre>

<p>Historical practice is that words on the <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> colon command line were subject to
abbreviation expansion, including the arguments to the <b>abbrev</b> (and more interestingly) the <b>unabbrev</b> command. Because
there are implementations that do not do abbreviation expansion for the first argument to those commands, this is permitted, but
not required, by POSIX.1-2017. However, the following sequence:</p>

<pre>
<tt>:ab foo bar
:ab foo baz
</tt>
</pre>

<p>resulted in the addition of an abbreviation of <tt>"baz"</tt> for the string <tt>"bar"</tt> in historical <i>ex</i>/ <a href=
"../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a>, and the sequence:</p>

<pre>
<tt>:ab foo1 bar
:ab foo2 bar
:unabbreviate foo2
</tt>
</pre>

<p>deleted the abbreviation <tt>"foo1"</tt>, not <tt>"foo2"</tt>. These behaviors are not permitted by POSIX.1-2017 because they
clearly violate the expectations of the user.</p>

<p>It was historical practice that &lt;control&gt;-V, not &lt;backslash&gt;, characters be interpreted as escaping subsequent
characters in the <b>abbreviate</b> command. POSIX.1-2017 requires conformance to historical practice; however, it should be noted
that an abbreviation containing a &lt;blank&gt; will never work.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_13"></a>Append</h5>

<p>Historically, any text following a &lt;vertical-line&gt; command separator after an <b>append</b>, <b>change</b>, or
<b>insert</b> command became part of the insert text. For example, in the command:</p>

<pre>
<tt>:g/pattern/append|stuff1
</tt>
</pre>

<p>a line containing the text <tt>"stuff1"</tt> would be appended to each line matching pattern. It was also historically valid to
enter:</p>

<pre>
<tt>:append|stuff1
stuff2
.
</tt>
</pre>

<p>and the text on the <i>ex</i> command line would be appended along with the text inserted after it. There was an historical bug,
however, that the user had to enter two terminating lines (the <tt>'.'</tt> lines) to terminate text input mode in this case.
POSIX.1-2017 requires conformance to historical practice, but disallows the historical need for multiple terminating lines.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_14"></a>Change</h5>

<p>See the RATIONALE for the <b>append</b> command. Historical practice for cursor positioning after the change command when no
text is input, is as described in POSIX.1-2017. However, one System V implementation is known to have been modified such that the
cursor is positioned on the first address specified, and not on the line before the first address. POSIX.1-2017 disallows this
modification for consistency.</p>

<p>Historically, the <b>change</b> command did not support buffer arguments, although some implementations allow the specification
of an optional buffer. This behavior is neither required nor disallowed by POSIX.1-2017.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_15"></a>Change Directory</h5>

<p>A common extension in <i>ex</i> implementations is to use the elements of a <b>cdpath</b> edit option as prefix directories for
<i>path</i> arguments to <b>chdir</b> that are relative pathnames and that do not have <tt>'.'</tt> or <tt>".."</tt> as their first
component. Elements in the <b>cdpath</b> edit option are &lt;colon&gt;-separated. The initial value of the <b>cdpath</b> edit
option is the value of the shell <i>CDPATH</i> environment variable. This feature was not included in POSIX.1-2017 because it does
not exist in any of the implementations considered historical practice.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_16"></a>Copy</h5>

<p>Historical implementations of <i>ex</i> permitted copies to lines inside of the specified range; for example, <b>:2,5copy3</b>
was a valid command. POSIX.1-2017 requires conformance to historical practice.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_17"></a>Delete</h5>

<p>POSIX.1-2017 requires support for the historical parsing of a <b>delete</b> command followed by flags, without any intervening
&lt;blank&gt; characters. For example:</p>

<dl compact>
<dt><b>1dp</b></dt>

<dd>Deletes the first line and prints the line that was second.</dd>

<dt><b>1delep</b></dt>

<dd>As for <b>1dp</b>.</dd>

<dt><b>1d</b></dt>

<dd>Deletes the first line, saving it in buffer <i>p</i>.</dd>

<dt><b>1d&nbsp;p1l</b></dt>

<dd>(Pee-one-ell.) Deletes the first line, saving it in buffer <i>p</i>, and listing the line that was second.</dd>
</dl>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_18"></a>Edit</h5>

<p>Historically, any <i>ex</i> command could be entered as a <b>+</b> <i>command</i> argument to the <b>edit</b> command, although
some (for example, <b>insert</b> and <b>append</b>) were known to confuse historical implementations. For consistency and
simplicity of specification, POSIX.1-2017 requires that any command be supported as an argument to the <b>edit</b> command.</p>

<p>Historically, the command argument was executed with the current line set to the last line of the file, regardless of whether
the <b>edit</b> command was executed from visual mode or not. POSIX.1-2017 requires conformance to historical practice.</p>

<p>Historically, the <b>+</b> <i>command</i> specified to the <b>edit</b> and <b>next</b> commands was delimited by the first
&lt;blank&gt;, and there was no way to quote them. For consistency, POSIX.1-2017 requires that the usual <i>ex</i> backslash
quoting be provided.</p>

<p>Historically, specifying the <b>+</b> <i>command</i> argument to the edit command required a filename to be specified as well;
for example, <b>:edit&nbsp;+100</b> would always fail. For consistency and simplicity of specification, POSIX.1-2017 does not
permit this usage to fail for that reason.</p>

<p>Historically, only the cursor position of the last file edited was remembered by the editor. POSIX.1-2017 requires that this be
supported; however, implementations are permitted to remember and restore the cursor position for any file previously edited.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_19"></a>File</h5>

<p>Historical versions of the <i>ex</i> editor <b>file</b> command displayed a current line and number of lines in the edit buffer
of 0 when the file was empty, while the <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> &lt;control&gt;-G command displayed a current
line and number of lines in the edit buffer of 1 in the same situation. POSIX.1-2017 does not permit this discrepancy, instead
requiring that a message be displayed indicating that the file is empty.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_20"></a>Global</h5>

<p>The two-pass operation of the <b>global</b> and <b>v</b> commands is not intended to imply implementation, only the required
result of the operation.</p>

<p>The current line and column are set as specified for the individual <i>ex</i> commands. This requirement is cumulative; that is,
the current line and column must track across all the commands executed by the <b>global</b> or <b>v</b> commands.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_21"></a>Insert</h5>

<p>See the RATIONALE for the <b>append</b> command.</p>

<p>Historically, <b>insert</b> could not be used with an address of zero; that is, not when the edit buffer was empty. POSIX.1-2017
requires that this command behave consistently with the <b>append</b> command.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_22"></a>Join</h5>

<p>The action of the <b>join</b> command in relation to the special characters is only defined for the POSIX locale because the
correct amount of white space after a period varies; in Japanese none is required, in French only a single space, and so on.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_23"></a>List</h5>

<p>The historical output of the <b>list</b> command was potentially ambiguous. The standard developers believed correcting this to
be more important than adhering to historical practice, and POSIX.1-2017 requires unambiguous output.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_24"></a>Map</h5>

<p>Historically, command mode maps only applied to command names; for example, if the character <tt>'x'</tt> was mapped to
<tt>'y'</tt>, the command <b>fx</b> searched for the <tt>'x'</tt> character, not the <tt>'y'</tt> character. POSIX.1-2017 requires
this behavior. Historically, entering &lt;control&gt;-V as the first character of a <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a>
command was an error. Several implementations have extended the semantics of <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> such that
&lt;control&gt;-V means that the subsequent command character is not mapped. This is permitted, but not required, by POSIX.1-2017.
Regardless, using &lt;control&gt;-V to escape the second or later character in a sequence of characters that might match a
<b>map</b> command, or any character in text input mode, is historical practice, and stops the entered keys from matching a map.
POSIX.1-2017 requires conformance to historical practice.</p>

<p>Historical implementations permitted digits to be used as a <b>map</b> command <i>lhs</i>, but then ignored the map.
POSIX.1-2017 requires that the mapped digits not be ignored.</p>

<p>The historical implementation of the <b>map</b> command did not permit <b>map</b> commands that were more than a single
character in length if the first character was printable. This behavior is permitted, but not required, by POSIX.1-2017.</p>

<p>Historically, mapped characters were remapped unless the <b>remap</b> edit option was not set, or the prefix of the mapped
characters matched the mapping characters; for example, in the <b>map</b>:</p>

<pre>
<tt>:map ab abcd
</tt>
</pre>

<p>the characters <tt>"ab"</tt> were used as is and were not remapped, but the characters <tt>"cd"</tt> were mapped if appropriate.
This can cause infinite loops in the <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> mapping mechanisms. POSIX.1-2017 requires
conformance to historical practice, and that such loops be interruptible.</p>

<p>Text input maps had the same problems with expanding the <i>lhs</i> for the <i>ex</i> <b>map!</b> and <b>unmap!</b> command as
did the <i>ex</i> <b>abbreviate</b> and <b>unabbreviate</b> commands. See the RATIONALE for the <i>ex</i> <b>abbreviate</b>
command. POSIX.1-2017 requires similar modification of some historical practice for the <b>map</b> and <b>unmap</b> commands, as
described for the <b>abbreviate</b> and <b>unabbreviate</b> commands.</p>

<p>Historically, <b>map</b>s that were subsets of other <b>map</b>s behaved differently depending on the order in which they were
defined. For example:</p>

<pre>
<tt>:map! ab     short
:map! abc    long
</tt>
</pre>

<p>would always translate the characters <tt>"ab"</tt> to <tt>"short"</tt>, regardless of how fast the characters <tt>"abc"</tt>
were entered. If the entry order was reversed:</p>

<pre>
<tt>:map! abc    long
:map! ab     short
</tt>
</pre>

<p>the characters <tt>"ab"</tt> would cause the editor to pause, waiting for the completing <tt>'c'</tt> character, and the
characters might never be mapped to <tt>"short"</tt>. For consistency and simplicity of specification, POSIX.1-2017 requires that
the shortest match be used at all times.</p>

<p>The length of time the editor spends waiting for the characters to complete the <i>lhs</i> is unspecified because the timing
capabilities of systems are often inexact and variable, and it may depend on other factors such as the speed of the connection. The
time should be long enough for the user to be able to complete the sequence, but not long enough for the user to have to wait. Some
implementations of <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> have added a <b>keytime</b> option, which permits users to set the
number of 0,1 seconds the editor waits for the completing characters. Because mapped terminal function and cursor keys tend to
start with an &lt;ESC&gt; character, and &lt;ESC&gt; is the key ending <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> text input
mode, <b>map</b>s starting with &lt;ESC&gt; characters are generally exempted from this timeout period, or, at least timed out
differently.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_25"></a>Mark</h5>

<p>Historically, users were able to set the &quot;previous context&quot; marks explicitly. In addition, the <i>ex</i> commands <b>&quot;</b>
and <b>'`</b> and the <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> commands <b>&quot;</b>, <b>``</b>, <b>`'</b>, and <b>'`</b> all
referred to the same mark. In addition, the previous context marks were not set if the command, with which the address setting the
mark was associated, failed. POSIX.1-2017 requires conformance to historical practice. Historically, if marked lines were deleted,
the mark was also deleted, but would reappear if the change was undone. POSIX.1-2017 requires conformance to historical
practice.</p>

<p>The description of the special events that set the <b>`</b> and <b>'</b> marks matches historical practice. For example,
historically the command <b>/a/,/b/</b> did not set the <b>`</b> and <b>'</b> marks, but the command <b>/a/,/b/delete</b> did.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_26"></a>Next</h5>

<p>Historically, any <i>ex</i> command could be entered as a <b>+</b> <i>command</i> argument to the <b>next</b> command, although
some (for example, <b>insert</b> and <b>append</b>) were known to confuse historical implementations. POSIX.1-2017 requires that
any command be permitted and that it behave as specified. The <b>next</b> command can accept more than one file, so usage such
as:</p>

<pre>
<tt>next `ls [abc] `
</tt>
</pre>

<p>is valid; it need not be valid for the <b>edit</b> or <b>read</b> commands, for example, because they expect only one
filename.</p>

<p>Historically, the <b>next</b> command behaved differently from the <b>:rewind</b> command in that it ignored the force flag if
the <b>autowrite</b> flag was set. For consistency, POSIX.1-2017 does not permit this behavior.</p>

<p>Historically, the <b>next</b> command positioned the cursor as if the file had never been edited before, regardless.
POSIX.1-2017 does not permit this behavior, for consistency with the <b>edit</b> command.</p>

<p>Implementations wanting to provide a counterpart to the <b>next</b> command that edited the previous file have used the command
<b>prev[ious],</b> which takes no <i>file</i> argument. POSIX.1-2017 does not require this command.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_27"></a>Open</h5>

<p>Historically, the <b>open</b> command would fail if the <b>open</b> edit option was not set. POSIX.1-2017 does not mention the
<b>open</b> edit option and does not require this behavior. Some historical implementations do not permit entering open mode from
open or visual mode, only from <i>ex</i> mode. For consistency, POSIX.1-2017 does not permit this behavior.</p>

<p>Historically, entering open mode from the command line (that is, <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> <b>+open</b>)
resulted in anomalous behaviors; for example, the <i>ex</i> file and <a href="../utilities/V3_chap02.html#set"><i>set</i></a>
commands, and the <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> command &lt;control&gt;-G did not work. For consistency,
POSIX.1-2017 does not permit this behavior.</p>

<p>Historically, the <b>open</b> command only permitted <tt>'/'</tt> characters to be used as the search pattern delimiter. For
consistency, POSIX.1-2017 requires that the search delimiters used by the <b>s</b>, <b>global</b>, and <b>v</b> commands be
accepted as well.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_28"></a>Preserve</h5>

<p>The <b>preserve</b> command does not historically cause the file to be considered unmodified for the purposes of future commands
that may exit the editor. POSIX.1-2017 requires conformance to historical practice.</p>

<p>Historical documentation stated that mail was not sent to the user when preserve was executed; however, historical
implementations did send mail in this case. POSIX.1-2017 requires conformance to the historical implementations.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_29"></a>Print</h5>

<p>The writing of NUL by the <b>print</b> command is not specified as a special case because the standard developers did not want
to require <i>ex</i> to support NUL characters. Historically, characters were displayed using the ARPA standard mappings, which are
as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Printable characters are left alone.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Control characters less than \177 are represented as <tt>'^'</tt> followed by the character offset from the <tt>'@'</tt>
character in the ASCII map; for example, \007 is represented as <tt>'^G'</tt>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>\177 is represented as <tt>'^'</tt> followed by <tt>'?'</tt>.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The display of characters having their eighth bit set was less standard. Existing implementations use hex (0x00), octal (\000),
and a meta-bit display. (The latter displayed bytes that had their eighth bit set as the two characters <tt>"M-"</tt> followed by
the seven-bit display as described above.) The latter probably has the best claim to historical practice because it was used for
the <b>-v</b> option of 4 BSD and 4 BSD-derived versions of the <a href="../utilities/cat.html"><i>cat</i></a> utility since
1980.</p>

<p>No specific display format is required by POSIX.1-2017.</p>

<p>Explicit dependence on the ASCII character set has been avoided where possible, hence the use of the phrase an
&quot;implementation-defined multi-character sequence&quot; for the display of non-printable characters in preference to the historical
usage of, for instance, <tt>"^I"</tt> for the &lt;tab&gt;. Implementations are encouraged to conform to historical practice in the
absence of any strong reason to diverge.</p>

<p>Historically, all <i>ex</i> commands beginning with the letter <tt>'p'</tt> could be entered using capitalized versions of the
commands; for example, <b>P[rint]</b>, <b>Pre[serve]</b>, and <b>Pu[t]</b> were all valid command names. POSIX.1-2017 permits, but
does not require, this historical practice because capital forms of the commands are used by some implementations for other
purposes.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_30"></a>Put</h5>

<p>Historically, an <i>ex</i> <b>put</b> command, executed from open or visual mode, was the same as the open or visual mode
<b>P</b> command, if the buffer was named and was cut in character mode, and the same as the <b>p</b> command if the buffer was
named and cut in line mode. If the unnamed buffer was the source of the text, the entire line from which the text was taken was
usually <b>put</b>, and the buffer was handled as if in line mode, but it was possible to get extremely anomalous behavior. In
addition, using the <b>Q</b> command to switch into <i>ex</i> mode, and then doing a <b>put</b> often resulted in errors as well,
such as appending text that was unrelated to the (supposed) contents of the buffer. For consistency and simplicity of
specification, POSIX.1-2017 does not permit these behaviors. All <i>ex</i> <b>put</b> commands are required to operate in line
mode, and the contents of the buffers are not altered by changing the mode of the editor.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_31"></a>Read</h5>

<p>Historically, an <i>ex</i> <b>read</b> command executed from open or visual mode, executed in an empty file, left an empty line
as the first line of the file. For consistency and simplicity of specification, POSIX.1-2017 does not permit this behavior.
Historically, a <b>read</b> in open or visual mode from a program left the cursor at the last line read in, not the first. For
consistency, POSIX.1-2017 does not permit this behavior.</p>

<p>Historical implementations of <i>ex</i> were unable to undo <b>read</b> commands that read from the output of a program. For
consistency, POSIX.1-2017 does not permit this behavior.</p>

<p>Historically, the <i>ex</i> and <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> message after a successful <b>read</b> or
<b>write</b> command specified &quot;characters&quot;, not &quot;bytes&quot;. POSIX.1-2017 requires that the number of bytes be displayed, not the
number of characters, because it may be difficult in multi-byte implementations to determine the number of characters read.
Implementations are encouraged to clarify the message displayed to the user.</p>

<p>Historically, reads were not permitted on files other than type regular, except that FIFO files could be read (probably only
because they did not exist when <i>ex</i> and <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> were originally written). Because the
historical <i>ex</i> evaluated <b>read!</b> and <b>read&nbsp;!</b> equivalently, there can be no optional way to force the read.
POSIX.1-2017 permits, but does not require, this behavior.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_32"></a>Recover</h5>

<p>Some historical implementations of the editor permitted users to recover the edit buffer contents from a previous edit session,
and then exit without saving those contents (or explicitly discarding them). The intent of POSIX.1-2017 in requiring that the edit
buffer be treated as already modified is to prevent this user error.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_33"></a>Rewind</h5>

<p>Historical implementations supported the <b>rewind</b> command when the user was editing the first file in the list; that is,
the file that the <b>rewind</b> command would edit. POSIX.1-2017 requires conformance to historical practice.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_34"></a>Substitute</h5>

<p>Historically, <i>ex</i> accepted an <b>r</b> option to the <b>s</b> command. The effect of the <b>r</b> option was to use the
last regular expression used in any command as the pattern, the same as the <b>&#152;</b> command. The <b>r</b> option is not
required by POSIX.1-2017. Historically, the <b>c</b> and <b>g</b> options were toggled; for example, the command <b>:s/abc/def/</b>
was the same as <b>s/abc/def/ccccgggg</b>. For simplicity of specification, POSIX.1-2017 does not permit this behavior.</p>

<p>The tilde command is often used to replace the last search RE. For example, in the sequence:</p>

<pre>
<tt>s/red/blue/
/green
&#152;
</tt>
</pre>

<p>the <b>&#152;</b> command is equivalent to:</p>

<pre>
<tt>s/green/blue/
</tt>
</pre>

<p>Historically, <i>ex</i> accepted all of the following forms:</p>

<pre>
<tt>s/abc/def/
s/abc/def
s/abc/
s/abc
</tt>
</pre>

<p>POSIX.1-2017 requires conformance to this historical practice.</p>

<p>The <b>s</b> command presumes that the <tt>'^'</tt> character only occupies a single column in the display. Much of the
<i>ex</i> and <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> specification presumes that the &lt;space&gt; only occupies a single
column in the display. There are no known character sets for which this is not true.</p>

<p>Historically, the final column position for the substitute commands was based on previous column movements; a search for a
pattern followed by a substitution would leave the column position unchanged, while a 0 command followed by a substitution would
change the column position to the first non- &lt;blank&gt;. For consistency and simplicity of specification, POSIX.1-2017 requires
that the final column position always be set to the first non- &lt;blank&gt;.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_35"></a>Set</h5>

<p>Historical implementations redisplayed all of the options for each occurrence of the <b>all</b> keyword. POSIX.1-2017 permits,
but does not require, this behavior.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_36"></a>Tag</h5>

<p>No requirement is made as to where <i>ex</i> and <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> shall look for the file referenced
by the tag entry. Historical practice has been to look for the path found in the <b>tags</b> file, based on the current directory.
A useful extension found in some implementations is to look based on the directory containing the tags file that held the entry, as
well. No requirement is made as to which reference for the tag in the tags file is used. This is deliberate, in order to permit
extensions such as multiple entries in a tags file for a tag.</p>

<p>Because users often specify many different tags files, some of which need not be relevant or exist at any particular time,
POSIX.1-2017 requires that error messages about problem tags files be displayed only if the requested tag is not found, and then,
only once for each time that the <b>tag</b> edit option is changed.</p>

<p>The requirement that the current edit buffer be unmodified is only necessary if the file indicated by the tag entry is not the
same as the current file (as defined by the current pathname). Historically, the file would be reloaded if the filename had
changed, as well as if the filename was different from the current pathname. For consistency and simplicity of specification,
POSIX.1-2017 does not permit this behavior, requiring that the name be the only factor in the decision.</p>

<p>Historically, <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> only searched for tags in the current file from the current cursor to
the end of the file, and therefore, if the <b>wrapscan</b> option was not set, tags occurring before the current cursor were not
found. POSIX.1-2017 considers this a bug, and implementations are required to search for the first occurrence in the file,
regardless.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_37"></a>Undo</h5>

<p>The <b>undo</b> description deliberately uses the word &quot;modified&quot;. The <b>undo</b> command is not intended to undo commands
that replace the contents of the edit buffer, such as <b>edit</b>, <b>next</b>, <b>tag</b>, or <b>recover</b>.</p>

<p>Cursor positioning after the <b>undo</b> command was inconsistent in the historical <a href=
"../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a>, sometimes attempting to restore the original cursor position (<b>global</b>, <b>undo</b>,
and <b>v</b> commands), and sometimes, in the presence of maps, placing the cursor on the last line added or changed instead of the
first. POSIX.1-2017 requires a simplified behavior for consistency and simplicity of specification.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_38"></a>Version</h5>

<p>The <b>version</b> command cannot be exactly specified since there is no widely-accepted definition of what the version
information should contain. Implementations are encouraged to do something reasonably intelligent.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_39"></a>Write</h5>

<p>Historically, the <i>ex</i> and <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> message after a successful <b>read</b> or
<b>write</b> command specified &quot;characters&quot;, not &quot;bytes&quot;. POSIX.1-2017 requires that the number of bytes be displayed, not the
number of characters because it may be difficult in multi-byte implementations to determine the number of characters written.
Implementations are encouraged to clarify the message displayed to the user.</p>

<p>Implementation-defined tests are permitted so that implementations can make additional checks; for example, for locks or file
modification times.</p>

<p>Historically, attempting to append to a nonexistent file caused an error. It has been left unspecified in POSIX.1-2017 to permit
implementations to let the <b>write</b> succeed, so that the append semantics are similar to those of the historical
<i>csh</i>.</p>

<p>Historical <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> permitted empty edit buffers to be written. However, since the way <a
href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> got around dealing with &quot;empty&quot; files was to always have a line in the edit buffer, no
matter what, it wrote them as files of a single, empty line. POSIX.1-2017 does not permit this behavior.</p>

<p>Historically, <i>ex</i> restored standard output and standard error to their values as of when <i>ex</i> was invoked, before
writes to programs were performed. This could disturb the terminal configuration as well as be a security issue for some terminals.
POSIX.1-2017 does not permit this, requiring that the program output be captured and displayed as if by the <i>ex</i> <b>print</b>
command.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_40"></a>Adjust Window</h5>

<p>Historically, the line count was set to the value of the <b>scroll</b> option if the type character was end-of-file. This
feature was broken on most historical implementations long ago, however, and is not documented anywhere. For this reason,
POSIX.1-2017 is resolutely silent.</p>

<p>Historically, the <b>z</b> command was &lt;blank&gt;-sensitive and <b>z&nbsp;+</b> and <b>z&nbsp;-</b> did different things than
<b>z+</b> and <b>z-</b> because the type could not be distinguished from a flag. (The commands <b>z&nbsp;.</b> and <b>z&nbsp;=</b>
were historically invalid.) POSIX.1-2017 requires conformance to this historical practice.</p>

<p>Historically, the <b>z</b> command was further &lt;blank&gt;-sensitive in that the <i>count</i> could not be
&lt;blank&gt;-delimited; for example, the commands <b>z=&nbsp;5</b> and <b>z-&nbsp;5</b> were also invalid. Because the
<i>count</i> is not ambiguous with respect to either the type character or the flags, this is not permitted by POSIX.1-2017.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_41"></a>Escape</h5>

<p>Historically, <i>ex</i> filter commands only read the standard output of the commands, letting standard error appear on the
terminal as usual. The <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> utility, however, read both standard output and standard error.
POSIX.1-2017 requires the latter behavior for both <i>ex</i> and <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a>, for consistency.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_42"></a>Shift Left and Shift Right</h5>

<p>Historically, it was possible to add shift characters to increase the effect of the command; for example, <b>&lt;&lt;&lt;</b>
outdented (or <b>&gt;&gt;&gt;</b> indented) the lines 3 levels of indentation instead of the default 1. POSIX.1-2017 requires
conformance to historical practice.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_43"></a>&lt;control&gt;-D</h5>

<p>Historically, the &lt;control&gt;-D command erased the prompt, providing the user with an unbroken presentation of lines from
the edit buffer. This is not required by POSIX.1-2017; implementations are encouraged to provide it if possible. Historically, the
&lt;control&gt;-D command took, and then ignored, a <i>count</i>. POSIX.1-2017 does not permit this behavior.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_44"></a>Write Line Number</h5>

<p>Historically, the <i>ex</i> <b>=</b> command, when executed in <i>ex</i> mode in an empty edit buffer, reported 0, and from open
or visual mode, reported 1. For consistency and simplicity of specification, POSIX.1-2017 does not permit this behavior.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_45"></a>Execute</h5>

<p>Historically, <i>ex</i> did not correctly handle the inclusion of text input commands (that is, <b>append</b>, <b>insert</b>,
and <b>change</b>) in executed buffers. POSIX.1-2017 does not permit this exclusion for consistency.</p>

<p>Historically, the logical contents of the buffer being executed did not change if the buffer itself were modified by the
commands being executed; that is, buffer execution did not support self-modifying code. POSIX.1-2017 requires conformance to
historical practice.</p>

<p>Historically, the <b>@</b> command took a range of lines, and the <b>@</b> buffer was executed once per line, with the current
line ( <tt>'.'</tt> ) set to each specified line. POSIX.1-2017 requires conformance to historical practice.</p>

<p>Some historical implementations did not notice if errors occurred during buffer execution. This, coupled with the ability to
specify a range of lines for the <i>ex</i> <b>@</b> command, makes it trivial to cause them to drop <b>core</b>. POSIX.1-2017
requires that implementations stop buffer execution if any error occurs, if the specified line doesn't exist, or if the contents of
the edit buffer itself are replaced (for example, the buffer executes the <i>ex</i> <b>:edit</b> command).</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_46"></a>Regular Expressions in ex</h5>

<p>Historical practice is that the characters in the replacement part of the last <b>s</b> command-that is, those matched by
entering a <tt>'&#152;'</tt> in the regular expression-were not further expanded by the regular expression engine. So, if the
characters contained the string <tt>"a.,"</tt> they would match <tt>'a'</tt> followed by <tt>".,"</tt> and not <tt>'a'</tt>
followed by any character. POSIX.1-2017 requires conformance to historical practice.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_47"></a>Edit Options in ex</h5>

<p>The following paragraphs describe the historical behavior of some edit options that were not, for whatever reason, included in
POSIX.1-2017. Implementations are strongly encouraged to only use these names if the functionality described here is fully
supported.</p>

<dl compact>
<dt><b>extended</b></dt>

<dd>The <b>extended</b> edit option has been used in some implementations of <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> to
provide extended regular expressions instead of basic regular expressions This option was omitted from POSIX.1-2017 because it is
not widespread historical practice.</dd>

<dt><b>flash</b></dt>

<dd>The <b>flash</b> edit option historically caused the screen to flash instead of beeping on error. This option was omitted from
POSIX.1-2017 because it is not found in some historical implementations.</dd>

<dt><b>hardtabs</b></dt>

<dd>The <b>hardtabs</b> edit option historically defined the number of columns between hardware tab settings. This option was
omitted from POSIX.1-2017 because it was believed to no longer be generally useful.</dd>

<dt><b>modeline</b></dt>

<dd>The <b>modeline</b> (sometimes named <b>modelines</b>) edit option historically caused <i>ex</i> or <a href=
"../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> to read the five first and last lines of the file for editor commands. This option is a
security problem, and vendors are strongly encouraged to delete it from historical implementations.</dd>

<dt><b>open</b></dt>

<dd>The <b>open</b> edit option historically disallowed the <i>ex</i> <b>open</b> and <b>visual</b> commands. This edit option was
omitted because these commands are required by POSIX.1-2017.</dd>

<dt><b>optimize</b></dt>

<dd>The <b>optimize</b> edit option historically expedited text throughput by setting the terminal to not do automatic
&lt;carriage-return&gt; characters when printing more than one logical line of output. This option was omitted from POSIX.1-2017
because it was intended for terminals without addressable cursors, which are rarely, if ever, still used.</dd>

<dt><b>ruler</b></dt>

<dd>The <b>ruler</b> edit option has been used in some implementations of <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> to present a
current row/column ruler for the user. This option was omitted from POSIX.1-2017 because it is not widespread historical
practice.</dd>

<dt><b>sourceany</b></dt>

<dd>The <b>sourceany</b> edit option historically caused <i>ex</i> or <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> to source
start-up files that were owned by users other than the user running the editor. This option is a security problem, and vendors are
strongly encouraged to remove it from their implementations.</dd>

<dt><b>timeout</b></dt>

<dd>The <b>timeout</b> edit option historically enabled the (now standard) feature of only waiting for a short period before
returning keys that could be part of a macro. This feature was omitted from POSIX.1-2017 because its behavior is now standard, it
is not widely useful, and it was rarely documented.</dd>

<dt><b>verbose</b></dt>

<dd>The <b>verbose</b> edit option has been used in some implementations of <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> to cause
<a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> to output error messages for common errors; for example, attempting to move the cursor
past the beginning or end of the line instead of only alerting the screen. (The historical <a href=
"../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> only alerted the terminal and presented no message for such errors. The historical editor
option <b>terse</b> did not select when to present error messages, it only made existing error messages more or less verbose.) This
option was omitted from POSIX.1-2017 because it is not widespread historical practice; however, implementors are encouraged to use
it if they wish to provide error messages for naive users.</dd>

<dt><b>wraplen</b></dt>

<dd>The <b>wraplen</b> edit option has been used in some implementations of <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> to specify
an automatic margin measured from the left margin instead of from the right margin. This is useful when multiple screen sizes are
being used to edit a single file. This option was omitted from POSIX.1-2017 because it is not widespread historical practice;
however, implementors are encouraged to use it if they add this functionality.</dd>
</dl>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_48"></a>autoindent, ai</h5>

<p>Historically, the command <b>0a</b> did not do any autoindentation, regardless of the current indentation of line 1.
POSIX.1-2017 requires that any indentation present in line 1 be used.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_49"></a>autoprint, ap</h5>

<p>Historically, the <b>autoprint</b> edit option was not completely consistent or based solely on modifications to the edit
buffer. Exceptions were the <b>read</b> command (when reading from a file, but not from a filter), the <b>append</b>,
<b>change</b>, <b>insert</b>, <b>global</b>, and <b>v</b> commands, all of which were not affected by <b>autoprint</b>, and the
<b>tag</b> command, which was affected by <b>autoprint</b>. POSIX.1-2017 requires conformance to historical practice.</p>

<p>Historically, the <b>autoprint</b> option only applied to the last of multiple commands entered using &lt;vertical-line&gt;
delimiters; for example, <b>delete</b> &lt;newline&gt; was affected by <b>autoprint</b>, but <b>delete|version</b> &lt;newline&gt;
was not. POSIX.1-2017 requires conformance to historical practice.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_50"></a>autowrite, aw</h5>

<p>Appending the <tt>'!'</tt> character to the <i>ex</i> <b>next</b> command to avoid performing an automatic write was not
supported in historical implementations. POSIX.1-2017 requires that the behavior match the other <i>ex</i> commands for
consistency.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_51"></a>ignorecase, ic</h5>

<p>Historical implementations of case-insensitive matching (the <b>ignorecase</b> edit option) lead to counter-intuitive situations
when uppercase characters were used in range expressions. Historically, the process was as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Take a line of text from the edit buffer.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Convert uppercase to lowercase in text line.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Convert uppercase to lowercase in regular expressions, except in character class specifications.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Match regular expressions against text.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>This would mean that, with <b>ignorecase</b> in effect, the text:</p>

<pre>
<tt>The cat sat on the mat
</tt>
</pre>

<p>would be matched by</p>

<pre>
<tt>/^the/
</tt>
</pre>

<p>but not by:</p>

<pre>
<tt>/^[A-Z]he/
</tt>
</pre>

<p>For consistency with other commands implementing regular expressions, POSIX.1-2017 does not permit this behavior.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_52"></a>paragraphs, para</h5>

<p>The ISO&nbsp;POSIX-2:1993 standard made the default <b>paragraphs</b> and <b>sections</b> edit options implementation-defined,
arguing they were historically oriented to the UNIX system <i>troff</i> text formatter, and a &quot;portable user&quot; could use the
<b>{</b>, <b>}</b>, <b>[[</b>, <b>]]</b>, <b>(</b>, and <b>)</b> commands in open or visual mode and have the cursor stop in
unexpected places. POSIX.1-2017 specifies their values in the POSIX locale because the unusual grouping (they only work when
grouped into two characters at a time) means that they cannot be used for general-purpose movement, regardless.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_53"></a>readonly</h5>

<p>Implementations are encouraged to provide the best possible information to the user as to the read-only status of the file, with
the exception that they should not consider the current special privileges of the process. This provides users with a safety net
because they must force the overwrite of read-only files, even when running with additional privileges.</p>

<p>The <b>readonly</b> edit option specification largely conforms to historical practice. The only difference is that historical
implementations did not notice that the user had set the <b>readonly</b> edit option in cases where the file was already marked
read-only for some reason, and would therefore reinitialize the <b>readonly</b> edit option the next time the contents of the edit
buffer were replaced. This behavior is disallowed by POSIX.1-2017.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_54"></a>report</h5>

<p>The requirement that lines copied to a buffer interact differently than deleted lines is historical practice. For example, if
the <b>report</b> edit option is set to 3, deleting 3 lines will cause a report to be written, but 4 lines must be copied before a
report is written.</p>

<p>The requirement that the <i>ex</i> <b>global</b>, <b>v</b>, <b>open</b>, <b>undo</b>, and <b>visual</b> commands present reports
based on the total number of lines added or deleted during the command execution, and that commands executed by the <b>global</b>
and <b>v</b> commands not present reports, is historical practice. POSIX.1-2017 extends historical practice by requiring that
buffer execution be treated similarly. The reasons for this are two-fold. Historically, only the report by the last command
executed from the buffer would be seen by the user, as each new report would overwrite the last. In addition, the standard
developers believed that buffer execution had more in common with <b>global</b> and <b>v</b> commands than it did with other
<i>ex</i> commands, and should behave similarly, for consistency and simplicity of specification.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_55"></a>showmatch, sm</h5>

<p>The length of time the cursor spends on the matching character is unspecified because the timing capabilities of systems are
often inexact and variable. The time should be long enough for the user to notice, but not long enough for the user to become
annoyed. Some implementations of <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> have added a <b>matchtime</b> option that permits
users to set the number of 0,1 second intervals the cursor pauses on the matching character.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_56"></a>showmode</h5>

<p>The <b>showmode</b> option has been used in some historical implementations of <i>ex</i> and <a href=
"../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> to display the current editing mode when in open or visual mode. The editing modes have
generally included &quot;command&quot; and &quot;input&quot;, and sometimes other modes such as &quot;replace&quot; and &quot;change&quot;. The string was usually
displayed on the bottom line of the screen at the far right-hand corner. In addition, a preceding <tt>'*'</tt> character often
denoted whether the contents of the edit buffer had been modified. The latter display has sometimes been part of the
<b>showmode</b> option, and sometimes based on another option. This option was not available in the 4 BSD historical implementation
of <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a>, but was viewed as generally useful, particularly to novice users, and is required
by POSIX.1-2017.</p>

<p>The <b>smd</b> shorthand for the <b>showmode</b> option was not present in all historical implementations of the editor.
POSIX.1-2017 requires it, for consistency.</p>

<p>Not all historical implementations of the editor displayed a mode string for command mode, differentiating command mode from
text input mode by the absence of a mode string. POSIX.1-2017 permits this behavior for consistency with historical practice, but
implementations are encouraged to provide a display string for both modes.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_57"></a>slowopen</h5>

<p>Historically, the <b>slowopen</b> option was automatically set if the terminal baud rate was less than 1200 baud, or if the baud
rate was 1200 baud and the <b>redraw</b> option was not set. The <b>slowopen</b> option had two effects. First, when inserting
characters in the middle of a line, characters after the cursor would not be pushed ahead, but would appear to be overwritten.
Second, when creating a new line of text, lines after the current line would not be scrolled down, but would appear to be
overwritten. In both cases, ending text input mode would cause the screen to be refreshed to match the actual contents of the edit
buffer. Finally, terminals that were sufficiently intelligent caused the editor to ignore the <b>slowopen</b> option. POSIX.1-2017
permits most historical behavior, extending historical practice to require <b>slowopen</b> behaviors if the edit option is set by
the user.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_58"></a>tags</h5>

<p>The default path for tags files is left unspecified as implementations may have their own <b>tags</b> implementations that do
not correspond to the historical ones. The default <b>tags</b> option value should probably at least include the file
<b>./tags</b>.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_59"></a>term</h5>

<p>Historical implementations of <i>ex</i> and <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> ignored changes to the <b>term</b> edit
option after the initial terminal information was loaded. This is permitted by POSIX.1-2017; however, implementations are
encouraged to permit the user to modify their terminal type at any time.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_60"></a>terse</h5>

<p>Historically, the <b>terse</b> edit option optionally provided a shorter, less descriptive error message, for some error
messages. This is permitted, but not required, by POSIX.1-2017. Historically, most common visual mode errors (for example, trying
to move the cursor past the end of a line) did not result in an error message, but simply alerted the terminal. Implementations
wishing to provide messages for novice users are urged to do so based on the <b>edit</b> option <b>verbose</b>, and not
<b>terse</b>.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_61"></a>window</h5>

<p>In historical implementations, the default for the <b>window</b> edit option was based on the baud rate as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>If the baud rate was less than 1200, the <b>edit</b> option <b>w300</b> set the window value; for example, the line:</p>

<pre>
<tt>set w300=12
</tt>
</pre>

<p>would set the window option to 12 if the baud rate was less than 1200.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If the baud rate was equal to 1200, the <b>edit</b> option <b>w1200</b> set the window value.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If the baud rate was greater than 1200, the <b>edit</b> option <b>w9600</b> set the window value.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The <b>w300</b>, <b>w1200</b>, and <b>w9600</b> options do not appear in POSIX.1-2017 because of their dependence on specific
baud rates.</p>

<p>In historical implementations, the size of the window displayed by various commands was related to, but not necessarily the same
as, the <b>window</b> edit option. For example, the size of the window was set by the <i>ex</i> command <b>visual 10</b>, but it
did not change the value of the <b>window</b> edit option. However, changing the value of the <b>window</b> edit option did change
the number of lines that were displayed when the screen was repainted. POSIX.1-2017 does not permit this behavior in the interests
of consistency and simplicity of specification, and requires that all commands that change the number of lines that are displayed
do it by setting the value of the <b>window</b> edit option.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_40_18_62"></a>wrapmargin, wm</h5>

<p>Historically, the <b>wrapmargin</b> option did not affect maps inserting characters that also had associated <i>count</i>s; for
example <b>:map&nbsp;K&nbsp;5aABC&nbsp;DEF</b>. Unfortunately, there are widely used maps that depend on this behavior. For
consistency and simplicity of specification, POSIX.1-2017 does not permit this behavior.</p>

<p>Historically, <b>wrapmargin</b> was calculated using the column display width of all characters on the screen. For example, an
implementation using <tt>"^I"</tt> to represent &lt;tab&gt; characters when the <b>list</b> edit option was set, where <tt>'^'</tt>
and <tt>'I'</tt> each took up a single column on the screen, would calculate the <b>wrapmargin</b> based on a value of 2 for each
&lt;tab&gt;. The <b>number</b> edit option similarly changed the effective length of the line as well. POSIX.1-2017 requires
conformance to historical practice.</p>

<p>Earlier versions of this standard allowed for implementations with bytes other than eight bits, but this has been modified in
this version.</p>
